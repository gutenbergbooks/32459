<h2>WORDSWORTH'S POETICAL WORKS</h2>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="Year_1806" id="Year_1806"></a>1806</h2>


<p>Wordsworth left Grasmere with his household for Coleorton
in November 1806, and there is no evidence that he returned to
Westmoreland till April 1808; although his sister spent part of
the winter of 1807-8 at Dove Cottage, while he and Mrs.
Wordsworth wintered at Stockton with the Hutchinson family.
Several of the sonnets which are published in the "Poems" of
1807 refer, however, to Grasmere, and were probably composed
there. I have conjecturally assigned a good many of them
to the year 1806. Some may have been composed earlier than
1806, but it is not likely that any belong to a later year.</p>

<p>In addition to these, the poems of 1806 include the <a href="#CHARACTER_OF_THE_HAPPY_WARRIOR"><i>Character
of the Happy Warrior</i></a>, unless it should be assigned to the close
of the previous year (see the note to the poem, <a href="#Page_11">p. 11</a>), <a href="#THE_HORN_OF_EGREMONT_CASTLE"><i>The Horn
of Egremont Castle</i></a>, the three poems composed in London in
the spring of the year (April or May)&mdash;viz. <a href="#STRAY_PLEASURES"><i>Stray Pleasures</i></a>,
<a href="#POWER_OF_MUSIC"><i>Power of Music</i></a>, and <a href="#STAR-GAZERS"><i>Star-gazers</i></a>&mdash;the lines on the Mountain
Echo, those composed in expectation of the death of Mr. Fox,
and the <i>Ode, Intimations of Immortality</i>.<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> Southey, in writing
to Sir Walter Scott, on the 4th of February 1806, said,
"Wordsworth has of late been more employed in correcting his
poems than in writing others."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p>[This person was Thomas Wilkinson, a Quaker by religious
profession; by natural constitution of mind&mdash;or, shall I venture
to say, by God's grace? he was something better. He had
inherited a small estate, and built a house upon it, near Yanwath,
upon the banks of the Emont. I have heard him say that his
heart used to beat, in his boyhood, when he heard the sound of
a drum and fife. Nevertheless the spirit of adventure in him
confined itself in tilling his ground, and conquering such
obstacles as stood in the way of its fertility. Persons of his
religious persuasion do now, in a far greater degree than formerly,
attach themselves to trade and commerce. He kept the old
track. As represented in this poem, he employed his leisure
hours in shaping pleasant walks by the side of his beloved river,
where he also built something between a hermitage and a
summer house, attaching to it inscriptions after the manner of
Shenstone at his Leasowes. He used to travel from time to
time, partly from love of Nature, and partly with religious
friends, in the service of humanity. His admiration of genius
in every department did him much honour. Through his
connection with the family in which Edmund Burke was
educated, he became acquainted with that great man, who used
to receive him with great kindness and condescension; and
many times I have heard Wilkinson speak of those interesting
interviews. He was honoured also by the friendship of Elizabeth
Smith, and of Thomas Clarkson and his excellent wife, and
was much esteemed by Lord and Lady Lonsdale, and every
member of that family. Among his verses (he wrote many) are
some worthy of preservation; one little poem in particular,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
upon disturbing, by prying curiosity, a bird while hatching her
young in his garden. The latter part of this innocent and good
man's life was melancholy. He became blind, and also poor,
by becoming surety for some of his relations. He was a
bachelor. He bore, as I have often witnessed, his calamities
with unfailing resignation. I will only add, that while working
in one of his fields, he unearthed a stone of considerable size,
then another, then two more; observing that they had been
placed in order, as if forming the segment of a circle, he
proceeded carefully to uncover the soil, and brought into view
a beautiful Druid's temple, of perfect, though small dimensions.
In order to make his farm more compact, he exchanged this
field for another, and, I am sorry to add, the new proprietor
destroyed this interesting relic of remote ages for some vulgar
purpose. The fact, so far as concerns Thomas Wilkinson, is
mentioned in the note on a sonnet on <i>Long Meg and her
Daughters</i>.&mdash;I. F.]</p>

<p>Thomas Wilkinson of Yanwath, the friend of Wordsworth
and the subject of these verses, deserves more than a passing note.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i13h">He was a man</span><br />
<span class="i2">Whom no one could have passed without remark.</span>
</div></div>

<p>One of the old race of Cumbrian "Statesmen"&mdash;men who owned,
and themselves cultivated, small bits of land (see Wordsworth's
letter on <i>The Brothers</i> and <i>Michael</i>, vol. ii. p. 234)&mdash;he
was Wordsworth's senior by nineteen years, and lived on
a patrimonial farm of about forty acres, on the banks of
the Emont,&mdash;the stream which, flowing out of Ullswater,
divides Cumberland from Westmoreland. He was a Friend,
and used to travel great distances to attend religious conferences,
or engage in philanthropic work,&mdash;on one occasion
riding on his pony from Yanwath to London, to the yearly
meeting of the Friends; and, on another, walking the 300
miles to town, in eight days, for the same purpose. A
simple, genuine nature; serene, refined, hospitable, naïve, and
humorous withal; a quaint original man, with a true eye for
Nature, a keen relish for rural life (especially for gardening) and
a happy knack of characterization, whether he undertook
descriptions of scenery in the course of his travels, or narrated
the incidents which befell him on the way. This is how he
writes of his farm, and his work upon it:&mdash;"We have at length
some traces of spring (6th April 1784); the primrose under the
hedge begins to open her modest flower, the buds begin to
swell, and the birds to build; yet we have still a wide horizon,
the mountain tops resign not their snows. The happiest season
of the year with me is now commencing&mdash;I mean that in which
I am at the plough; my horses pace slowly on before, the larks
sing above my head, and the furrow falls at my side, and the
face of Nature and my own mind seem to wear a sweet and
cheerful tranquillity."</p>

<p>The following extract shows the interest which he took in
the very implements of his industry, and may serve as an
illustration of Wordsworth's stanzas on his "spade." "Eighth
month, 16th, 1789. Yesterday I parted without regret from
an old acquaintance&mdash;I set by my scythe for this year. I have
often this season seen the dark blue mountains before the sun
and his rising embroider them with gold. I have had many a
good sleep in the shade among fragrant grass and refreshing
breezes, and though closely engaged in what may be thought
heavy work, I was sensible of the enjoyments of life with uninterrupted
health." In the closing years of the last century,
when the spirit of patriotic ardour was so thoroughly roused in
England by the restlessness of France and the ambition of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
Napoleon, he lived on at his pastoral farm, "busy with his
husbandry." In London, he made the acquaintance of Edmund
Burke; and Thomas Clarkson, the philanthropist,&mdash;whose
labours for the abolition of the slave trade are matter of history,&mdash;became
his intimate friend, and was a frequent visitor at
Yanwath. Clarkson afterwards bought an estate near to
Wilkinson's home, on the shores of Ullswater, where he built
a house, and named it Eusemere, and there the Wordsworths
were not infrequent guests. (See the note to the poem beginning
"I wandered lonely as a cloud," vol. iii. p. 5.) Wordsworth
stayed at Yanwath for two days in 1806. The <i>Tours
to the British Mountains, with the Descriptive Poems of
Lowther and Emont Vale</i> (London, 1824), have been referred
to in the note to <i>The Solitary Reaper</i>, vol. ii. p. 399, one of
the poems in the "Memorials of a Tour in Scotland, 1803."
It is an interesting volume&mdash;the prose much superior to the
verse&mdash;and might be reprinted with advantage. Wilkinson
was urged repeatedly to publish his "Tour through the Highlands,"
but he always declined, and it was printed at last without
his knowledge, by some one to whom he had lent his MS.</p>

<p>Wilkinson's relations to Wordsworth are alluded to in the
note to <i>The Solitary Reaper</i>. He is occasionally referred to in
Dorothy Wordsworth's Grasmere Journal of January and March
1802, <i>e.g.</i>:&mdash;"Monday, 12th March.&mdash;The ground covered
with snow. Walked to T. Wilkinson's and sent for letters.
The woman brought me one from Wm. and Mary. It was a
sharp windy night. Thomas Wilkinson came with me to
Barton, and questioned me like a catechiser all the way. Every
question was like the snapping of a little thread about my heart.
I was so full of thought of my half-read letter and other things."</p>

<p>The following are extracts from letters of Wilkinson to Miss
Mary Leadbeater of Ballintore:&mdash;"Yanwath, 15. 2. 1801.&mdash;I
had lately a young Poet seeing me that sprang originally from
the next village. He has left the College, turned his back on
all preferment, and settled down contentedly among our Lakes,
with his Sister and his Muse. He ... writes in what he
conceives to be the language of Nature in opposition to the
finery of our present poetry. He has published two volumes of
Poems, mostly of the same character. His name is William
Wordsworth." In a letter, dated 29. 1. 1809, the following
occurs:&mdash;"Thou hast wished to have W. Wordsworth's Lines
on my Spade, which I shall transcribe thee. I had promised
Lord Lonsdale to take him to Lowther, when he came to see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
me, but when we arrived he was gone to shoot moor-game with
Judge Sutton. William and I then returned, and wrought
together at a walk I was then forming, which gave birth to his
Verses." The expression "sprang from the next village"
might not be intended to mean that he was born there; or, if
it did, the fact that Wordsworth's mother was a native of
Penrith, and his own visits to that town, might account for the
mistake of one who had made no minute enquiry as to the poet's
birthplace. He was born at Cockermouth. Compare an
interesting account of Thomas Wilkinson, by Mary Carr, reprinted
from the <i>Friends' Quarterly Examiner</i>, 1882.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p class="center">Composed 1806.&mdash;Published 1807</p>


<p>[The course of the great war with the French naturally fixed
one's attention upon the military character, and, to the honour
of our country, there were many illustrious instances of the
qualities that constitute its highest excellence. Lord Nelson
carried most of the virtues that the trials he was exposed to in
his department of the service necessarily call forth and sustain,
if they do not produce the contrary vices. But his public life
was stained with one great crime, so that though many passages
of these lines were suggested by what was generally known as
excellent in his conduct, I have not been able to connect his
name with the poem as I could wish, or even to think of him
with satisfaction in reference to the idea of what a warrior ought
to be. For the sake of such of my friends as may happen to
read this note, I will add that many elements of the character
here pourtrayed were found in my brother John, who perished
by shipwreck, as mentioned elsewhere. His messmates used to
call him the Philosopher, from which it must be inferred that
the qualities and dispositions I allude to had not escaped their
notice. He often expressed his regret, after the war had
continued some time, that he had not chosen the Naval, instead
of the East India Company's, service, to which his family
connection had led him. He greatly valued moral and religious
instruction for youth, as tending to make good sailors. The
best, he used to say, came from Scotland; the next to them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
from the North of England, especially from Westmoreland and
Cumberland, where, thanks to the piety and local attachments
of our ancestors, endowed, or, as they are commonly called,
free, schools abound.&mdash;I. F.]</p>

<p>The following note was appended by Wordsworth in the edition
of 1807. "The above Verses were written soon after tidings
had been received of the Death of Lord Nelson, which event
directed the Author's thoughts to the subject. His respect for
the memory of his great fellow-countryman induces him to
mention this; though he is well aware that the Verses must
suffer from any connection in the Reader's mind with a Name
so illustrious."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>This note would seem to warrant our removing the date of
the composition of the poem from 1806 to 1805; since Lord
Nelson died at the battle of Trafalgar, on the 21st of October
1805. On the other hand, Wordsworth himself gave the date
1806; and the "soon after" of the above note may perhaps be
stretched to include two months and a half. In writing to Sir
George Beaumont on the 11th of February 1806, and enclosing
a copy of these verses, he says, "they were written several
weeks ago." Southey, writing to Sir Walter Scott, from Keswick,
on the 4th of February 1806, says, "Wordsworth was
with me last week; he has of late been more employed in
correcting his poems than in writing others; but one piece he
has written, upon the ideal character of a soldier, than which
I have never seen anything more full of meaning and sound
thought. The subject was suggested by Nelson's most glorious
death, though having no reference to it. He had some thoughts
of sending it to <i>The Courier</i>, in which case you will easily
recognise his hand." (<i>The Life and Correspondence of Robert
Southey</i>, vol. iii. p. 19.) As it is impossible to decide with
accuracy, in the absence of more definite data, I follow the
poet's own statement, and assign it to the year 1806.</p>

<p>Wordsworth tells us that features in the character, both of
Lord Nelson and of his own brother John, are delineated in this
poem. Mr. William Davies writes to me, "He might very
well have set the name of Cuthbert, Lord Collingwood, Nelson's
contemporary, at the head of the poem, as embodying its spirit
and lofty rule of life."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p>The following note is appended to this poem in the edition
of 1807, and in those of 1836 to 1850:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot">"This Story is a Cumberland tradition; I have heard it also
related of the Hall of Hutton John, an antient residence of the
Huddlestones, in a sequestered Valley upon the River Dacor."</p>

<p>Egremont Castle, to which this Cumberland tradition was
transferred, is close to the town of Egremont, an ancient
borough on the river Ehen, not far from St. Bees. The castle
was founded about the beginning of the twelfth century, by
William, brother of Ranulph de Meschines, who bestowed on
William the whole of the extensive barony of Copeland. The
gateway of the castle is vaulted with semi-circular arches, and
defended by a strong tower. Westward from the castle area is
an ascent to three narrow gates, standing in a line, and close
together. These communicated with the outworks, each being
defended by a portcullis. Beyond the gates is an artificial
mound, seventy-eight feet above the moat; and on this stood
an ancient circular tower. (See a description of the castle in
Britton and Brayley's <i>Cumberland</i>.) The river Dacor, or
Dacre, referred to in Wordsworth's note, joins the Emont a
short way below Ullswater; and the hall of Hutton John,
which in the reign of Edward III. belonged to the barony of
Graystock, passed in the time of Elizabeth to the Huddlestones.
The famous Catholic father, John Huddlestone, chaplain to
Charles II. and James II., was of this family.</p>

<p>In the edition of 1815, there is the following footnote to the
title of the poem:&mdash;"This Poem and the Ballad which follows
it" (it was that of <i>Goody Blake and Harry Gill</i>), "as they
rather refer to the imagination than are produced by it, would
not have been placed here" (<i>i.e.</i> among the "Poems of the
Imagination"), "but to avoid a needless multiplication of the
Classes."</p>

<p>The text of 1807 underwent no change until 1845. But&mdash;as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
is shown by the notes in the late Lord Coleridge's copy of the
edition of 1836&mdash;the alterations subsequently adopted in 1845
were made in the interval between these years.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p class="center">Composed 1806.&mdash;Published 1807</p>


<p>[Suggested on the Thames by the sight of one of those
floating mills that used to be seen there. This I noticed on
the Surrey side between Somerset House and Blackfriars'
Bridge. Charles Lamb was with me at the time; and I
thought it remarkable that I should have to point out to <i>him</i>,
an idolatrous Londoner, a sight so interesting as the happy
group dancing on the platform. Mills of this kind used to be,
and perhaps still are, not uncommon on the continent. I
noticed several upon the river Saone in the year 1799, particularly
near the town of Chalons, where my friend Jones and
I halted a day when we crossed France; so far on foot; there
we embarked, and floated down to Lyons.&mdash;I. F.]</p>

<p>Wordsworth went up to London in April 1806, where he
stayed two months. It was, doubtless, on that occasion that
these lines were written. The year mentioned in the Fenwick
note is incorrect. It was in 1790 that Wordsworth crossed
France with his friend Jones.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

Nab-scar, when I was walking on the opposite side of Rydal

while she was sitting alone one day high up on this part of Loughrigg
Fell, she was so affected by the voice of the Cuckoo heard
from the crags at some distance that she could not suppress a
wish to have a stone inscribed with her name among the rocks
from which the sound proceeded. On my return from my
walk I recited these verses to Mrs. Wordsworth.&mdash;I. F.]</p>

Rydal. The Fenwick note refers to a wish of Dorothy Wordsworth
to have her name inscribed on a stone among the rocks
of Loughrigg Fell. It is impossible to know whether it was
ever carried out or not. If it was, the place is undiscoverable,
like the spot on the banks of the Rotha, where Joanna's name
was graven "deep in the living rock," or the place where
Wordsworth carved his wife's initials (as recorded in Mrs.
Hemans' <i>Memoirs</i>), or where the daisy was found, which
suggested the lines beginning</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Small service is true service while it lasts;</span>

<p>and it is well that they are undiscoverable. It is so easy for
posterity to vulgarise, by idle and unappreciative curiosity,
spots that are sacred only to the few who feel them to be
shrines. The very grave where Wordsworth rests runs the
risk of being thus abused by the unthinking crowd. But, in
the hope that no one will desecrate it, as the Rock of Names
has been injured, I may mention that there is a stone near
Rydal Mere, on the north-eastern slope of Loughrigg, with the
initial "M." deeply cut. The exact locality I need not more
minutely indicate.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<h2><a name="NUNS_FRET_NOT_AT_THEIR_CONVENTS" id="NUNS_FRET_NOT_AT_THEIR_CONVENTS"></a>"NUNS FRET NOT AT THEIR CONVENT'S
NARROW ROOM"</h2>

<p class="center">Composed 1806.&mdash;Published 1807</p>


<p>[In the cottage, Town-end, Grasmere, one afternoon in 1801,
my sister read to me the sonnets of Milton. I had long been
well acquainted with them, but I was particularly struck on
that occasion with the dignified simplicity and majestic harmony
that runs through most of them,&mdash;in character so totally different
from the Italian, and still more so from Shakspeare's fine
sonnets. I took fire, if I may be allowed to say so, and produced
three sonnets the same afternoon, the first I ever wrote,
except an irregular one at school. Of these three, the only one
I distinctly remember is&mdash;"I grieved for Buonaparté." One
was never written down; the third, which was, I believe, preserved,
I cannot particularise.&mdash;I. F.]</p>

<p>From 1807 to 1820 this was named <i>Prefatory Sonnet</i>, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
introducing the series of "Miscellaneous Sonnets" in these
editions. In 1827 it took its place as the first in that series,
following the Dedication <i>To &mdash;&mdash;</i>.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p>In Wordsworth's time "Furness-fells" was a generic phrase
for all the hills east of the Duddon, south of the Brathay, and
west of Windermere; including the Coniston group, Wetherlam,
with the Yewdale and Tilberthwaite fells. The district of
Furness, like that of Craven in Yorkshire, being originally
ecclesiastical, had a wide area, of which the abbey of Furness
was the centre.</p>

<p>In the Fenwick note prefixed to this sonnet, Wordsworth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
refers to his earliest attempt at sonnet writing. He says he
wrote an irregular one at school, and the next were three
sonnets written one afternoon in Dove Cottage in the year 1801,
after his sister had read the sonnets of Milton. This note is
not, however, to be trusted. It was not in 1801, but on the
21st of May 1802, that his sister read to him these sonnets of
Milton; and he afterwards wrote not one but two sonnets on
Buonaparte. What the irregular sonnet written at school was
it is impossible to say, unless he refers to the one entitled, in
1807 and subsequent editions, <i>Written in Very Early Youth</i>;
and beginning&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Calm is all nature as a resting wheel.</span>
</div></div>

<p>But on a copy of <i>An Evening Walk</i> (1793 edition) Wordsworth
wrote:&mdash;"This is the first of my published poems, with
the exception of a sonnet, written when I was a schoolboy,
and published in the <i>European Magazine</i> in June or July
1786, and signed Axiologus." Even as to this date his
memory was at fault. It was published in 1787, when he was
seventeen years of age. Its full title may be given; although,
for reasons already stated, it would be unjustifiable to republish
the sonnet, except in an appendix to the poems, and mainly for
its biographical interest. It was entitled, <i>Sonnet, on seeing
Miss Maria Williams weep at a Tale of Distress</i>. But, fully
ten years before the date mentioned by Dorothy Wordsworth in
her Grasmere Journal&mdash;as the day on which she read Milton's
sonnets to her brother, and on which he wrote the two on
Buonaparte&mdash;he had written others, the existence of which he
had evidently forgotten. On the 6th of May 1792, his sister
wrote thus from Forncett Rectory in Norfolk to her friend, Miss
Jane Pollard:&mdash;"I promised to transcribe some of William's
compositions. As I made the promise, I will give you a little
sonnet.... I take the first that offers. It is very valuable
to me, because the cause which gave birth to it was the favourite
evening walk of William and me.... I have not chosen
this sonnet from any particular beauty it has. <i>It was the first
I laid my hands upon.</i>" From the clause I have italicised, it
would almost seem that other sonnets belong to that period,
viz. before 1793, when <i>An Evening Walk</i> appeared. She
would hardly have spoken of it as she did, if this was the only
sonnet her brother had then written. Though very inferior to
his later work, this sonnet may be preserved as a specimen of
Wordsworth's earlier manner, before he had broken away, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
the force of his own imagination, from the trammels of the conventional
style, which he inherited. It is printed in the
Appendix to volume viii.</p>

<p>It will be seen that Wordsworth's memory cannot be always
relied upon, in reference to dates, and similar details, in the
Fenwick memoranda.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"By my half-kitchen and half-parlour fire."</span>
</div></div>

<p>My sister and I were in the habit of having the tea-kettle in
our little sitting room; and we toasted the bread ourselves,
which reminds me of a little circumstance not unworthy to be
set down among these minutiæ. Happening both of us to be
engaged a few minutes one morning when we had a young prig
of a Scotch lawyer to breakfast with us, my dear Sister, with
her usual simplicity, put the toasting fork with a slice of bread
into the hands of this Edinburgh genius. Our little book-case
stood on one side of the fire. To prevent loss of time, he took
down a book, and fell to reading, to the neglect of the toast,
which was burnt to a cinder. Many a time have we laughed
at this circumstance, and other cottage simplicities of that day.
By the bye, I have a spite at one of this series of Sonnets (I
will leave the reader to discover which) as having been the
means of nearly putting off for ever our acquaintance with dear
Miss Fenwick, who has always stigmatized one line of it as
vulgar, and worthy only of having been composed by a country
squire.&mdash;I. F.]</p>

<p>In 1815, this was classed among the "Poems proceeding
from Sentiment and Reflection." From 1820 to 1843,
it found a place among the "Miscellaneous Sonnets," and in
1845 was restored to its earlier one among the "Poems of
Sentiment and Reflection."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>

<p>The reading of 1807,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>was a reminiscence of Dove Cottage, which we regret to lose in

<p>In the Baptistery of Westminster Abbey, there is a statue of
Wordsworth by Frederick Thrupp of great merit, placed there
by the late Dean Stanley, beside busts of Keble, Maurice, and
Kingsley. Underneath the statue of Wordsworth are the four
lines from <i>Personal Talk</i>&mdash;</p>

<p>The cottage at Town-end, Grasmere&mdash;where this sonnet
was composed&mdash;may have suggested it. Some of the details,
however, are scarcely applicable to Dove Cottage; the "brook"
(referred to elsewhere) is outside the orchard ground, and there
is scarcely anything in the garden to warrant the phrase, "its
own small pasture." It is unnecessary to localise the allusions.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p>Raisley Calvert was the son of R. Calvert, steward to the
Duke of Norfolk. Writing to Sir George Beaumont, on the
20th February 1805, Wordsworth said, "I should have been
forced into one of the professions" (the church or law) "by
necessity, had not a friend left me £900. This bequest was
from a young man with whom, though I call him friend, I had
but little connection; and the act was done entirely from a
confidence on his part that I had powers and attainments which
might be of use to mankind.... Upon the interest of the
£900, and £100 legacy to my sister, and £100 more which
the 'Lyrical Ballads' have brought me, my sister and I contrived
to live seven years, nearly eight." To his friend Matthews he
wrote, November 7th, 1794, "My friend" (Calvert) "has
every symptom of a confirmed consumption, and I cannot think
of quitting him in his present debilitated state." And in
January 1795 he wrote to Matthews from Penrith (where
Calvert was staying), "I have been here for some time. I am
still much engaged with my sick friend; and am sorry to add
that he worsens daily ... he is barely alive." In a letter to
Dr. Joshua Stanger of Keswick, written in the year 1842,
Wordsworth referred thus to Raisley Calvert. Dr. Calvert&mdash;a
nephew of Raisley, and son of the W. Calvert whom the poet
accompanied to the Isle of Wight and Salisbury in 1793&mdash;had
just died. "His removal (Dr. Calvert's) has naturally thrown
my mind back as far as Dr. Calvert's grandfather, his father,
and sister (the former of whom was, as you know, among my
intimate friends), and his uncle Raisley, whom I have so much
cause to remember with gratitude for his testamentary remembrance
of me, when the greatest part of my patrimony was
kept back from us by injustice. It may be satisfactory to your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
wife for me to declare that my friend's bequest enabled me to
devote myself to literary pursuits, independent of any necessity
to look at pecuniary emolument, so that my talents, such as they
might be, were free to take their natural course. Your brothers
Raisley and William were both so well known to me, and I
have so many reasons to respect them, that I cannot forbear
saying, that my sympathy with this last bereavement is deepened
by the remembrance that they both have been taken from
you...." On October 1, 1794, Wordsworth wrote from
Keswick to Ensign William Calvert about his brother Raisley.
(The year is not given in the letter, but it must have been
1794.) He tells him that Raisley was determined to set out
for Lisbon; but that he (Wordsworth) could not brook the
idea of his going alone; and that he wished to accompany his
friend and stay with him, till his health was re-established.
He adds, "Reflecting that his return is uncertain, your brother
requests me to inform you that he has drawn out his will, which
he means to get executed in London. The purport of his will
is to leave you all his property, real and personal, chargeable
with a legacy of £600 to me, in case that, on inquiry into the
state of our affairs in London, he should think it advisable to
do so. It is at my request that this information is communicated
to you." Calvert did not live to go south; and he changed
the sum left to Wordsworth from £600 to £900. The relationship
of the two men suggests the somewhat parallel one between
Spinoza and Simon de Vries.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p>Charles James Fox died September 13, 1806. He was
Minister for Foreign Affairs at the time, having assumed office
on the 5th February, shortly after the death of William Pitt.
Wordsworth's sadness on this occasion, his recognition of Fox
as great and good, and as "a Power" that was "passing from
the earth," may have been due partly to personal and political
sympathy, but also probably to Fox's appreciation of the better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
side of the French Revolution, and to his welcoming the
pacific proposals of Talleyrand, perhaps also to his efforts for
the abolition of slavery.</p>

<p>The "lonely road" referred to in these <i>Lines</i>, was, in all
likelihood, the path from Town-end towards the Swan Inn
past the Hollins, Grasmere. A "mighty unison of streams"
may be heard there any autumn evening after a stormy day,
and especially after long continued rain, the sound of waters
from Easdale, from Greenhead Ghyll, and the slopes of Silver
How, blending with that of the Rothay in the valley below.

in Scotland</i>, in 1803, p. 229 (edition 1874).&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p>Wordsworth dated this poem 1806, and said to Miss
Fenwick that it was written at Grasmere. If it was written
"during a boisterous winter evening" in 1806, it could not
have been written at Grasmere; because the Wordsworths spent
most of that winter at Coleorton. I am inclined to believe that
the date which the poet gave is wrong, and that the <i>Address</i>
really belongs to the year 1805; but, as it is just possible that&mdash;although
referring to winter&mdash;it may have been written at Town-end
in the summer of 1806, it is placed among the poems belonging
to the latter year.</p>

<p>This <i>Address</i> was translated into French by Mme. Amable
Tastu, and published in a popular school-book series of extracts,
but Wordsworth's name is not given along with the translation.</p>

<p>From 1815 to 1843 the authorship was veiled under the
title, "by a female Friend of the Author." In 1845, it was
disclosed, "by my Sister."</p>

<p>In 1815 Charles Lamb wrote to Wordsworth, "We were
glad to see the poems 'by a female friend.' The one of the
Wind is masterly, but not new to us. Being only three,
perhaps you might have clapt a D. at the corner, and let it
have past as a printer's mark to the uninitiated, as a delightful
hint to the better instructed. As it is, expect a formal criticism
on the poems of your female friend, and she must expect it."

p. 285.)&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p>One of the MS. readings of the ninth line of this sonnet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
gives the date of the incident as "now seven years gone"; but
I leave the date of composition undetermined. If we could
know accurately the date of the "first visit" to the district with
his sister (referred to in the Fenwick note), and if we could
implicitly trust this MS. reading, it might be possible to fix it;
but we can do neither. Wordsworth visited the Lake District
with his sister as early as 1794, and in December 1799 he took
up his abode with her at Dove Cottage. I have no doubt that
the sonnet belongs to the year 1806, or was composed at an
earlier date. As to the locality of the rill, the late Rev. R.
Perceval Graves, of Dublin, wrote to me:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"It was in 1843, when quitting the parsonage at Bowness,
I went to reside at Dovenest, that, calling one day at Rydal
Mount, I was told by both Mr. and Mrs. Wordsworth, as a
fact in which I should take a special interest, that the 'little
unpretending rill' associated by the poet with 'the immortal
spirit of one happy day,' was the rill which, rising near High
Skelgill at the back of Wansfell, descends steeply down the
hill-side, passes behind the house at Dovenest, and crossing
beneath the road, enters the lake near the gate of the drive
which leads up to Dovenest.</p>

<p>"The authority on which I give this information is decisive
of the question. I have often traced upwards the course of the
rill; and the secluded hollow, which by its source is beautified
with fresh herbage and wild straggling bushes, was a favourite
haunt of mine."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<h2><a name="Year_1807" id="Year_1807"></a>1807</h2>


<p>In few instances is it more evident that the dates which Wordsworth
affixed to his poems, in the editions of 1815, 1820,
1836, and 1845,&mdash;and those assigned in the Fenwick notes&mdash;cannot
be absolutely relied upon, than in the case of the
poems referring to Coleorton. Trusting to these dates, in the
absence of contrary evidence, one would naturally assign the
majority of the Coleorton poems to the year 1808. But it
is clear that, while the sonnet <a href="#TO_LADY_BEAUMONT"><i>To Lady Beaumont</i></a> may have
been written in 1806, the "Inscription" <a href="#FOR_A_SEAT_IN_THE_GROVES_OF"><i>For a Seat in the
Groves of Coleorton</i></a>, beginning&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Beneath yon eastern ridge, the craggy bound,</span>
</div></div>

<p>was written, not in 1808 (as stated by Wordsworth himself),
but in 1811; and that the other "Inscription" designed for a
Niche in the Winter-garden at Coleorton, belongs (I think) to
the same year; a year in which he also wrote the sonnet on Sir
George Beaumont's picture of Bredon Hill and Cloud Hill,
beginning&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Praised be the Art whose subtle power could stay.</span>
</div></div>

<p>When the dates are so difficult to determine, there is a
natural fitness in bringing all the poems referring to Coleorton
together, so far as this can be done without seriously interfering
with chronological order. The two "Inscriptions" intended for
the Coleorton grounds, which were written at Grasmere in
1811, are therefore printed along with the poems of 1807; the
precise date of each being given&mdash;so far as it can be ascertained&mdash;underneath
its title.</p>

<p>Several political sonnets, and others, were written in 1807;
also the <a href="#SONG_AT_THE_FEAST_OF_BROUGHAM"><i>Song at the Feast of Brougham Castle</i></a>, and the first and
larger part of <a href="#THE_WHITE_DOE_OF_RYLSTONE"><i>The White Doe of Rylstone</i></a>, with a few minor

Doe of Rylstone</i></a> (see <a href="#Page_191">p. 191</a>), I have assigned that poem to the
year 1808. The <a href="#SONG_AT_THE_FEAST_OF_BROUGHAM"><i>Song at the Feast of Brougham Castle</i></a> forms as
natural a preface to <a href="#THE_WHITE_DOE_OF_RYLSTONE"><i>The White Doe</i></a>, as <a href="#THE_FORCE_OF_PRAYERA"><i>The Force of Prayer, a
Tradition of Bolton Abbey</i></a>, is its natural appendix. The latter
was written, however, before <a href="#THE_WHITE_DOE_OF_RYLSTONE"><i>The White Doe of Rylstone</i></a> was
finished.</p>

<p>It would be easier to fix the date of some of the poems
written between the years 1806 and 1808, if we knew the exact
month in which the two volumes of 1807 were published; but
this, I fear, it is impossible to discover now.</p>

<p>On November 10th, 1806, Wordsworth wrote to Sir George
Beaumont from Coleorton, "In a day or two I mean to send a
sheet or two of my intended volume to the press" (evidently
referring to the "Poems" of 1807). On the following day&mdash;11th
November 1806&mdash;Dorothy Wordsworth wrote to Lady Beaumont,
"William has written two other poems, which you will
see when they are printed. He composes frequently in the
grove.... We have not yet received a sheet from the printer."
On the 15th November 1806 she again wrote to Lady Beaumont
(from Coleorton), "My brother works very hard at his poems,
preparing them for the press. Miss Hutchinson is the transcriber."
In a subsequent letter from Coleorton, undated, but
bearing the post-mark February 18, 1807, she is speaking of
her brother's poetical labour, and says, "He must go on, when
he begins: and any interruptions (such as attending to the
progress of the workmen and planning the garden) are of the
greatest use to him; for, after a certain time, the progress is by
no means proportioned to the labour in composition; and if he
is called from it by other thoughts, he returns to it with ten
times the pleasure, and the work goes on proportionately the
more rapidly." From this we may infer that the years 1806-7
were productive ones, but it is disappointing that the dates of
the composition of the poems are so difficult to determine.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p>The title, <i>To Lady Beaumont</i>, was first given in 1845. In
1807 it was <i>To the &mdash;&mdash;</i>; in 1815, <i>To the Lady &mdash;&mdash;</i>; and
from 1820 to 1843, <i>To the Lady Beaumont</i>.</p>

<p>This winter garden, fashioned by the Wordsworths out of
the old quarry at Coleorton, during Sir George and Lady
Beaumont's absence in 1807, exists very much as it was at the
beginning of the century. The "perennial bowers and murmuring
pines" may still be seen, little altered since 1807. The
late Sir George Beaumont (whose grandfather was first-cousin
to the artist Sir George, Wordsworth's friend), with strong
reverence for the past, and for the traditions of literary men
which have made the district famous since the days of his
ancestor Beaumont the dramatist, and especially for the
memorials of Wordsworth's ten months' residence at Coleorton,&mdash;took
a pleasure in preserving these memorials, very much as
they were when he entered in possession of the estates of his
ancestors.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span> Such a reverence for the past is not only consistent
with the "improvement" of an estate, and its belongings; it
is a part of it. Wordsworth, and his wife and sister, were
adepts in the laying out of grounds. (See the reference to the
poet's joint labour with Wilkinson at Yanwath, <a href="#Page_2">p. 2</a>.) It was
the Wordsworths also, I believe, who designed the grounds of
Fox How&mdash;Dr. Arnold's residence, near Ambleside. Similar
memorials of the poet survive at Hallsteads, Ullswater. The
following is an extract from the letter of Dorothy Wordsworth to
Lady Beaumont above referred to, and having the post-mark
of February 18, 1807. "For more than a week we have
had the most delightful weather. If William had but waited
a few days, it would have been no anticipation when he said to
you, 'the songs of Spring were in the grove;' for all this week
the birds have chanted from morn till evening, larks, blackbirds,
thrushes, and far more than I can name, and the busy rooks
have joined their happy voices."</p>

<p>Wordsworth, writing to Sir George Beaumont, November
16, 1811, says, "I remember, Mr. Bowles, the poet, objected
to the word 'ravishment' at the end of the sonnet to the winter-garden;
yet it has the authority of all the first-rate poets, for
instance, Milton:</p>

<p>In 1807 the whole of the Continent of Europe was prostrate
under the power of Napoleon. It is impossible to say to what
special incident, if to any in particular, Wordsworth refers in
the phrase, "with holy glee thou fought'st against him;" but,
as the sonnet was composed at Coleorton in 1807&mdash;after
the battles of Austerlitz and Jena, and Napoleon's practical
mastery of Europe&mdash;our knowing the particular event or events
in Swiss history to which he refers, would not add much to our
understanding of the poem.</p>

<p>In the Fenwick note Wordsworth incorrectly separates his
<i>Song on the Restoration of Lord Clifford</i> from the <i>Feast of
Brougham Castle</i>. They are the same song.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p>On the 25th of March 1807, the Royal assent was given to

Clarkson. Its abolition was voted by the House of Lords on
the motion of Lord Grenville, and by the Commons on the
motion of Charles James Fox, on the 10th of June 1806. The
bill was read a second time in the Lords on the 5th of February,

<p>Mrs. Wordsworth corrected her husband's note to Miss
Fenwick, by adding in the MS., "at Coleorton"; and at
Coleorton the Wordsworths certainly spent the winter of 1806,
the Town-end Cottage at Grasmere being too small for their
increasing household. It is more likely that Wordsworth wrote
the poem at Coleorton than at Grasmere, and it looks as if it
had been an evening impromptu, after hearing both the nightingale
and the stock-dove. There are no nightingales at Grasmere,&mdash;they
are not heard further north than the Trent valley,&mdash;while
they used to abound in the "peaceful groves" of Coleorton.
If the locality was&mdash;as Mrs. Wordsworth states&mdash;Coleorton, and
if the lines were written after hearing the nightingale, the year
would be 1807, and not 1806 (the poet's own date). The
nightingale is a summer visitor in this country, and could not
have been heard by Wordsworth at Coleorton in 1806, as he
did not go south to Leicestershire till November in that year.
But it is quite possible that it was "the stock-dove's voice"
that alone suggested the lines, and that they were written either
in 1806, or (as I think more likely), very early in 1807.
In the month of January Wordsworth was corresponding with
Scott about the poems in this edition of 1807.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p>[Written at Coleorton. This old man's name was Mitchell.
He was, in all his ways and conversation, a great curiosity,
both individually and as a representative of past times. His
chief employment was keeping watch at night by pacing round
the house, at that time building, to keep off depredators. He
has often told me gravely of having seen the Seven Whistlers,
and the Hounds as here described. Among the groves of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
Coleorton, where I became familiar with the habits and notions
of old Mitchell, there was also a labourer of whom, I regret, I
had no personal knowledge; for, more than forty years after,
when he was become an old man, I learned that while I was
composing verses, which I usually did aloud, he took much
pleasure, unknown to me, in following my steps that he might
catch the words I uttered; and, what is not a little remarkable,
several lines caught in this way kept their place in his memory.
My volumes have lately been given to him by my informant,
and surely he must have been gratified to meet in print his old
acquaintances.&mdash;I. F.]</p>

<p>I am indebted to Mr. William Kelly of Leicester for the
following note on the Leicestershire superstition of the Seven
Whistlers.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>"There is an old superstition, which it is not easy to get to
the bottom of, concerning a certain cry or sound heard in the
night, supposed to be produced by the Seven Whistlers. What
or who those whistlers are is an unsolved problem. In some
districts they are popularly believed to be witches, in others
ghosts, in others devils, while in the Midland Counties they are
supposed to be birds, either plovers or martins&mdash;some say swifts.
In Leicestershire it is deemed a bad omen to hear the Seven
Whistlers, and our old writers supply many passages illustrative
of the popular credulity. Spenser, in his <i>Faërie Queene</i>, book
<span class="allcapsc">II.</span> canto xii. stanza 36, speaks of</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">The whistler shrill, that whoso hears doth die.</span>
</div></div>

<p>Sir Walter Scott, in <i>The Lady of the Lake</i>, names the bird with
which his character associated the cry&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">And in the plover's shrilly strain</span><br />
<span class="i2">The signal whistlers heard again.</span>
</div></div>

<p>"When the colliers of Leicestershire are flush of money, we
are told, and indulge in a drinking bout, they sometimes hear
the warning voice of the Seven Whistlers, get sobered and
frightened, and will not descend the pit again till next day.
Wordsworth speaks of a countryman who</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i5h">... the seven birds hath seen, that never part,</span><br />
<span class="i2">Seen the Seven Whistlers in their nightly rounds,</span><br />
<span class="i2">And counted them.</span>
</div></div>

<p>"A few years ago, during a thunderstorm which passed over
Leicestershire, and while vivid lightning was darting through
the sky, immense flocks of birds were seen flying about, uttering
doleful, affrighted cries as they passed, and keeping up for a
long time a continual whistling like that made by some kinds
of sea-birds. The number must have been immense, for the
local newspapers mentioned the same phenomenon in different
parts of the neighbouring counties of Northampton, Leicester,
and Lincoln. A gentleman, conversing with a countryman on
the following day, asked him what kind of birds he supposed
them to have been. The man answered, 'They are what we
call the Seven Whistlers,' and added that 'whenever they are
heard it is considered a sign of some great calamity, and that
the last time he had heard them was on the night before the
deplorable explosion of fire damp at the Hartley Colliery.'"</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>In <i>Notes and Queries</i> there are several allusions to this local
superstition. In the Fifth Series (vol. ii. p. 264), Oct. 3,
1874, the editor gives a summary of several notes on the
subject in vol. viii. of the Fourth Series (pp. 68, 134, 196,
and 268), with additional information. He says "record was
made of their having been heard in Leicestershire; and that
the develin or martin, the swift, and the plover were probably
of the whistling fraternity that frightened men. At p. 134 it
was shown that Wordsworth had spoken of one who</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i5h">... the seven birds hath seen, that never part,</span><br />
<span class="i2">Seen the Seven Whistlers in their nightly rounds,</span><br />
<span class="i2">And counted them.</span>
</div></div>

<p>On the same page, the swift is said to be the true whistler (but,
as noted at page 196, the swifts never make nightly rounds),
and the superstition is said to be common in our Midland
Counties. At page 268, Mr. Pearson put on record that in
Lancashire the plovers, whistling as they fly, are accounted
heralds of ill, though sometimes of trivial accident, and that
they are there called 'Wandering Jews,' and are said to be, or
to carry with them, the ever-restless souls of those Jews who
assisted at the Crucifixion. At page 336, the whistlers are
chronicled as having been the harbingers of the great Hartley
Colliery explosion. A correspondent, <span class="smcap">Viator</span>, added, that on
the Bosphorus there are flocks of birds, the size of a thrush,
which fly up and down the channel, and are never seen to rest
on land or water. The men who rowed Viator's caique told
him that they were the souls of the damned, condemned to
perpetual motion. The Seven Whistlers have not furnished
chroniclers with later circumstances of their tuneful and awful
progresses till a week or two ago.... The whistlers are also
heard and feared in Portugal. See <i>The New Quarterly</i> for July
1874, for a record of some travelling experience in that country."</p>

<p>Another extract from <i>Notes and Queries</i> is to the following
effect:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"'Your Excellency laughs at ghosts. But there is no lie
about the Seven Whistlers. Many a man besides me has heard
them.'</p>

<p>"'Who are the Seven Whistlers? and have you seen them
yourself?'</p>

<p>"'Not seen, thank Heaven; but I have heard them plenty
of times. Some say they are the ghosts of children unbaptized,
who are to know no rest till the judgment day. Once last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
winter I was going with donkeys and a mule to Caia. Just at
the moment I stopped by the river bank to tighten the mule's
girth, I heard the accursed whistlers coming down the wind
along the river. I buried my head under the mule, and never
moved till the danger was over; but they passed very near, for
I heard the flap and rustle of their wings.'</p>

<p>"'What was the danger?'</p>

<p>"'If a man once sees them, heaven only knows what will
not happen to him&mdash;death and damnation at the very least.'</p>

<p>"'I have seen them many times. I shot, or tried to shoot
them!'</p>

<p>"'Holy Mother of God! you English are an awful people!
You shot the Seven Whistlers?'</p>

<p>"'Yes; we call them marecos (teal or widgeon) in our
country, and shoot them whenever we can. They are better
to eat than wild ducks.'"</p>
</div>

<p><i>Gabriel's Hounds.</i>&mdash;"At Wednesbury in Staffordshire, the
colliers going to their pits early in the morning hear the noise
of a pack of hounds in the air, to which they give the name of
Gabriel's Hounds, though the more sober and judicious take
them only to be wild geese making this noise in their flight."
Kennet MS., Lansd. 1033. (See Halliwell's <i>Dictionary of
Archaic and Provincial Words</i>, vol. i. p. 388.) The peculiar
cry or cackle, both of the Brent Goose and of the Bean or
Harvest Goose (<i>Anser Segetum</i>), has often been likened to that
of a pack of hounds in full cry&mdash;especially when the birds are
on the wing during night. For some account of the superstition
of "Gabriel's Hounds," see <i>Notes and Queries</i>, First Series,
vol. v. pp. 534 and 596; and vol. xii. p. 470; Second
Series, vol. i. p. 80; and Fourth Series, vol. vii. p. 299.
In the last note these hounds are said to be popularly believed
to be "the souls of unbaptized children wandering in the air
till the day of judgment." They are also explained as "a thing
in the air, that is said in these parts (Sheffield) to foretell
calamity, sounding like a great pack of beagles in full cry."
This quotation is from Charles Reade's <i>Put yourself in his
place</i>, which contains many scraps of local folk-lore. The following
is from the <i>Statistical History of Kirkmichael</i>, by the Rev.
John Grant. "In the autumnal season, when the moon shines
from a serene sky, often is the wayfaring traveller arrested by
the music of the hills. Often struck with a more sober scene,
he beholds the visionary hunters engaged in the chase, and
pursuing the deer of the clouds, while the hollow rocks in long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
sounding echoes reverberate their cries." "There are several
now living who assert that they have seen and heard this aërial
hunting." See the <i>Statistical History of Scotland</i>, edited by
Sir J. Sinclair, vol. xii. pp. 461, 462. Compare note to <i>An
Evening Walk</i>, vol. i. p. 19.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p>About twelve years after the last visit of Wordsworth to
Coleorton, referred to in the Fenwick note&mdash;of which the date
should, I think, be 1842, not 1841&mdash;this cedar tree fell,
uprooted during a storm. It was, however, as the Coleorton
gardener who was then on the estate told me, replanted with
much labour, and protected with care; although, the top branches
being injured, it was never quite the same as it had been.
During the night of the great storm on the 13th October 1880,
however, it fell a second time, and perished irretrievably. The
memorial stone remains, injured a good deal by the wear and
tear of time; and the inscription is more than half obliterated.
It is in a situation much more exposed to the elements than
the other two inscriptions at Coleorton. He</p>

<span class="i5h">who sang how spear and shield</span><br />
<span class="i2">In civil conflict met on Bosworth-field,</span>
</div></div>

<p>was Sir John Beaumont, the brother of the dramatist, who
wrote a poem on the battle of Bosworth. (See one of Wordsworth's
notes to the <i>Song at the Feast of Brougham Castle</i>, <a href="#Footnote_B_185">p. 98</a>.)
The</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i5h">famous Youth, full soon removed</span><br />
<span class="i2">From earth,</span>
</div></div>

<p>was Francis Beaumont, the dramatist, who wrote in conjunction
with Fletcher. He died at the age of twenty-nine.</p>

<p>In an undated letter addressed to Sir George Beaumont,
Wordsworth wrote, "I like your ancestor's verses the more,
the more I see of them. They are manly, dignified, and
extremely harmonious. I do not remember in any author of
that age such a series of well-tuned couplets."</p>

<p>In another letter written from Grasmere (probably in 1811)
to Sir George, he says in reference to his own poems, "These
inscriptions have all one fault, they are too long; but I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
unable to do justice to the thoughts in less room. The second
has brought Sir John Beaumont and his brother Francis so livelily
to my mind that I recur to the plan of republishing the former's
poems, perhaps in connection with those of Francis."</p>

<p>On November 16, 1811, he wrote to him again, "I am glad
that the inscriptions please you. It did always appear to me,
that inscriptions, particularly those in verse, or in a dead
language, were never supposed <i>necessarily</i> to be the composition
of those in whose name they appeared. If a more striking or
more dramatic effect could be produced, I have always thought,
that in an epitaph or memorial of any kind, a father or husband,
etc., might be introduced speaking, without any absolute deception
being intended; that is, the reader is understood to be at
liberty to say to himself,&mdash;these verses, or this Latin, may be
the composition of some unknown person, and not that of the
father, widow, or friend, from whose hand or voice they profess
to proceed.... I have altered the verses, and I have only
to regret that the alteration is not more happily done. But I
never found anything more difficult. I wished to preserve the
expression <i>patrimonial grounds</i>,<a name="FNanchor_A_157" id="FNanchor_A_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_157" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> but I found this impossible, on
account of the awkwardness of the pronouns, he and his, as
applied to Reynolds, and to yourself. This, even when it does
not produce confusion, is always inelegant. I was, therefore,
obliged to drop it; so that we must be content, I fear, with
the inscription as it stands below. I hope it will do. I tried
a hundred different ways, but cannot hit upon anything
better...."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p>[This Niche is in the sandstone-rock in the winter-garden
at Coleorton, which garden, as has been elsewhere said, was
made under our direction out of an old unsightly quarry. While
the labourers were at work, Mrs. Wordsworth, my sister and I
used to amuse ourselves occasionally in scooping this seat out
of the soft stone. It is of the size, with something of the
appearance, of a stall in a Cathedral. This inscription is
not engraven, as the former and the two following are, in the

<p>This niche is still to be seen, although not quite "unconscious
of decay." The growth of yew-trees, over and around it, has
darkened the seat; and constant damp has decayed the soft
stone. The niche having been scooped out by Mrs. Wordsworth
and Dorothy, as well as by Wordsworth, suggests the cutting
of the inscriptions on the Rock of Names in 1800, in which
they all took part. (See vol. iii. pp. 61, 62.) On his return to
Grasmere from Coleorton, Wordsworth wrote thus to Sir George
Beaumont, in an undated letter, about this inscription:&mdash;"What
follows I composed yesterday morning, thinking there might
be no impropriety in placing it so as to be visible only to a
person sitting within the niche, which is hollowed out of the
sandstone in the winter-garden. I am told that this is, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
present form of the niche, impossible; but I shall be most ready,
when I come to Coleorton, to scoop out a place for it, if Lady
Beaumont think it worth while." Then follows the&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">Oft is the medal faithful to its trust.</p>

<p>On Nov. 16, 1811, writing again to Sir George on this
subject of the "Inscriptions," and evidently referring to this one
on the "Niche," he says, "As to the 'Female,' and 'Male,'
I know not how to get rid of it; for that circumstance gives
the recess an appropriate interest.... On this account, the
lines had better be suppressed, for it is not improbable that
the altering of them might cost me more trouble than writing
a hundred fresh ones."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

the former being allegorical figures; the latter, living men."</p>
</div>

<p>This letter&mdash;which is not now in the Beaumont collection at
Coleorton Hall&mdash;seems to imply that Wordsworth thought of
combining the first couplet on the Urn with the last nine lines
of the inscription for the stone behind the Cedar tree. But
this was never carried out. The inscriptions are printed in
the text as they were carved at Coleorton.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p>refers probably to High Cadmon. The nunnery of Grace Dieu
was a religious house, in a retired spot near the centre of the
forest; and was built between 1236 and 1242. The English
monasteries were suppressed in 1536; but Grace Dieu, with
thirty others of the smaller monasteries, was allowed to continue
some time longer. It was finally suppressed in 1539, when the
site of the priory, with the demesne lands, was granted to Sir
Humphrey Foster, who conveyed the whole to John Beaumont.
Francis Beaumont, the dramatic poet, was born at Grace Dieu
in 1586. He died in 1615, and was buried in Westminster
Abbey.</p>

<p>"William and I went to Grace Dieu last week. We were
enchanted with the little valley and its nooks, and the rocks of
Charnwood upon the hill."&mdash;Dorothy Wordsworth to Lady
Beaumont, November 17, 1806.</p>

<p>This "Inscription" was composed at Grasmere, November
19, 1811, as the following extract from a letter of Wordsworth's
to Lady Beaumont indicates:&mdash;"Grasmere, Wednesday,
November 20, 1811.&mdash;My Dear Lady Beaumont&mdash;When you
see this you will think I mean to overrun you with inscriptions.
I do not mean to tax you with putting them up, only with
reading them. The following I composed yesterday morning
in a walk from Brathay, whither I had been to accompany my
sister:&mdash;</p>

which worthily blemished the author (saith Speed); But who,
as he adds, 'dare promise any thing temperate of himself in the
heat of martial fury? chiefly, when it was resolved not to leave
any branch of the York line standing; for so one maketh this
Lord to speak.' This, no doubt, I would observe by the bye,
was an action sufficiently in the vindictive spirit of the times,
and yet not altogether so bad as represented; 'for the Earl
was no child, as some writers would have him, but able to
bear arms, being sixteen or seventeen years of age, as is evident
from this (say the Memoirs of the Countess of Pembroke, who
was laudably anxious to wipe away, as far as could be, this
stigma from the illustrious name to which she was born); that
he was the next Child to King Edward the Fourth, which his
mother had by Richard Duke of York, and that King was then
eighteen years of age: and for the small distance betwixt her
Children, see Austin Vincent in his book of Nobility, page 622,
where he writes of them all. It may further be observed, that
Lord Clifford, who was then himself only twenty-five years of
age, had been a leading Man and Commander, two or three
years together in the Army of Lancaster, before this time; and,
therefore, would be less likely to think that the Earl of Rutland
might be entitled to mercy from his youth.&mdash;But, independent
of this act, at best a cruel and savage one, the Family of Clifford
had done enough to draw upon them the vehement hatred of
the House of York: so that after the Battle of Towton there
was no hope for them but in flight and concealment. Henry,
the subject of the Poem, was deprived of his estate and honours
during the space of twenty-four years; all which time he lived
as a shepherd in Yorkshire, or in Cumberland, where the estate
of his Father-in-law (Sir Lancelot Threlkeld) lay. He was
restored to his estate and honours in the first year of Henry the
Seventh. It is recorded that, 'when called to parliament, he
behaved nobly and wisely; but otherwise came seldom to
London or the Court; and rather delighted to live in the
country, where he repaired several of his Castles, which had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
gone to decay during the late troubles.' Thus far is chiefly
collected from Nicholson and Burn; and I can add, from my
own knowledge, that there is a tradition current in the village
of Threlkeld and its neighbourhood, his principal retreat, that,
in the course of his shepherd life, he had acquired great
astronomical knowledge. I cannot conclude this note without
adding a word upon the subject of those numerous and noble
feudal Edifices, spoken of in the Poem, the ruins of some of
which are, at this day, so great an ornament to that interesting
country. The Cliffords had always been distinguished for an
honourable pride in these Castles; and we have seen that after
the wars of York and Lancaster they were rebuilt; in the civil
Wars of Charles the First, they were again laid waste, and
again restored almost to their former magnificence by the
celebrated Lady Anne Clifford, Countess of Pembroke, etc. etc.
Not more than twenty-five years after this was done, when the
Estates of Clifford had passed into the Family of Tufton, three
of these Castles, namely Brough, Brougham, and Pendragon,
were demolished, and the timber and other materials sold by
Thomas Earl of Thanet. We will hope that, when this order
was issued, the Earl had not consulted the text of Isaiah, 58th
Chap. 12th Verse, to which the inscription placed over the gate
of Pendragon Castle, by the Countess of Pembroke (I believe
his Grandmother) at the time she repaired that structure, refers
the reader. '<i>And they that shall be of thee shall build the old
waste places; thou shalt raise up the foundations of many
generations, and thou shalt be called the repairer of the breach,
the restorer of paths to dwell in.</i>' The Earl of Thanet, the
present possessor of the Estates, with a due respect for the
memory of his ancestors, and a proper sense of the value and
beauty of these remains of antiquity, has (I am told) given
orders that they shall be preserved from all depredations."</p>

<p>Brougham Castle, past which the river Emont flows, is
about two miles out of Penrith, on the Appleby Road. It is
now a ruin, but was once a place of importance. The larger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
part of it was built by Roger, Lord Clifford, son of Isabella
de Veteripont, who placed over the inner door the inscription,
"This made Roger." His grandson added the eastern part.
The castle was frequently laid waste by the Scottish Bands,
and during the Wars of the Roses. The Earl of Cumberland
entertained James I. within it, in 1617, on the occasion of the
king's last return from Scotland; but it seems to have "layen
ruinous" from that date, and to have suffered much during the
civil wars in the reign of Charles I. In 1651-52 it was repaired
by Lady Anne Clifford, Countess Dowager of Pembroke, who
wrote thus&mdash;"After I had been there myself to direct the
building of it, did I cause my old decayed castle of Brougham
to be repaired, and also the tower called the "Roman Tower," in
the same old castle, and the court-house, for keeping my courts
in, with some dozen or fourteen rooms to be built in it upon
the old foundation." (<i>Pembroke Memoirs</i>, i. p. 216.) After
the time of the Countess Anne, the castle was neglected, and
much of the stone, timber, and lead disposed of at public sales:
the wainscotting being purchased by the neighbouring villagers.</p>

</div></div>

<p>Skipton is the "capital" of the Craven district of Yorkshire,
as Barrow is the capital of the Furness district of Lancashire
and Westmoreland. The castle of Skipton was the chief
residence of the Cliffords. Architecturally it is of two periods:
the round tower dating from the reign of Edward II., and the
rest from that of Henry VIII. From the time of Robert de
Clifford, who fell at Bannockburn (1314), until the seventeenth
century, the estates of the Cliffords extended from Skipton to
Brougham Castle&mdash;seventy miles&mdash;with only a short interruption
of ten miles. The "Shepherd-lord" Clifford of this poem
was attainted&mdash;as explained in Wordsworth's note&mdash;by the
triumphant House of York. He was "committed by his
mother to the care of certain shepherds, whose wives had
served her," and who kept him concealed both in Cumberland,
and at Londesborough, in Yorkshire, where his mother's (Lady
Margaret Vesci) own estates lay. The old "Tower" of
Skipton Castle was "deserted" during these years when the
"Shepherd-lord" was concealed in Cumberland.</p>

<span class="i2"><i>How glad Pendragon&mdash;though the sleep</i></span><br />

</div></div>

<p>Pendragon Castle, in a narrow dell in the forest of Mallerstang,
near the source of the Eden, south of Kirkby-Stephen,
was another of the castles of the Cliffords. Its building was
traditionally ascribed to Uter Pendragon, of Stonehenge
celebrity, who was fabled to have tried to make the Eden flow
round the castle of Pendragon: hence the distich&mdash;</p>

<p>In the Countess of Pembroke's <i>Memoirs</i> (vol. i. pp. 22,
228), we are told that Idonea de Veteripont "made a great
part of her residence in Westmoreland at Brough Castle, near
Stanemore, and at Pendragon Castle, in Mallerstang." The
castle was burned and destroyed by Scottish raiders in 1341,
and for 140 years it was in a ruinous state. It is probably to
this that reference is made in the phrase, "though the sleep of
years be on her." During the attainder of Henry Lord
Clifford, in the reign of Edward IV., part of this estate of
Mallerstang was granted to Sir William Parr of Kendal Castle.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
It was again destroyed during the civil wars of the Stuarts, and
was restored, along with Skipton and Brougham, by Lady
Anne Clifford, in 1660, who put up an inscription
"... Repaired in 1660, so as she came to lye in it herself
for a little while in October 1661, after it had lain ruinous
without timber or any other covering since 1541. Isaiah, chap.
lviii. ver. 12." It was again demolished in 1685.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2"><i>Rejoiced is Brough, right glad I deem</i></span><br />
<span class="i2"><i>Beside her little humble stream.</i></span>
</div></div>

<p>Brough&mdash;the Verterae of the Romans&mdash;is called, for distinction's
sake, "Brough-under-Stainmore" (or "Stanemore").
The "little humble stream" is Hillbeck, formerly Hellebeck&mdash;(it
was said to derive its name from the waters rushing or
"helleing" down the channel)&mdash;which descends from Warcop
Fell, runs through Market Brough, and joins the Eden below it.
The date of the building of the castle of Brough is uncertain, but
it is probably older than the Conquest. It was sacked by the
Scottish King William in 1174. It was "one of the chief
residences" of Idonea de Veteripont (above referred to);
for "then it was in its prime." (<i>Pemb. Mem.</i>, vol. i.
p. 22.) Probably she rebuilt it, and changed it from a tower&mdash;like
Pendragon&mdash;into a castle. In the <i>Pembroke Memoirs</i>
(i. p. 108), we read of its subsequent destruction by fire. "A
great misfortune befell Henry Lord Clifford, some two years
before his death, which happened in 1521; his ancient and
great castle of Brough-under-Stanemore was set on fire by a
casual mischance, a little after he had kept a great Christmas
there, so as all the timber and lead were utterly consumed, and
nothing left but the bare walls, which since are more and more
consumed, and quite ruinated." This same Countess Anne
Pembroke began to repair it in April 1660, "at her exceeding
great charge and cost." She put up an inscription over the
gate similar to the one which she inscribed at Pendragon.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2"><i>And she that keepeth watch and ward</i></span><br />
<span class="i2"><i>Her statelier Eden's course to guard.</i></span>
</div></div>

<p>Doubtless Appleby Castle. Its origin is equally uncertain.
Before 1422, John Lord Clifford, "builded that strong and
fine artificial gate-house, all arched with stone, and decorated
with the arms of the Veteriponts, Cliffords, and Percys, which
with several parts of the castle walls was defaced and broken
down in the civil war of 1648." His successor, Thomas, Lord<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
Clifford, "built the chiefest part of the castle towards the east,
as the hall, the chapel, and the great chamber." This was in
1454. The Countess Anne Pembroke wrote of Appleby Castle
thus (<i>Pemb. Mem.</i>, vol. i. p. 187): "In 1651 I continued to
live in Appleby Castle a whole year, and spent much time in
repairing it and Brougham Castle, to make them as habitable
as I could, though Brougham was very ruinous, and much out
of repair. And in this year, the 21st of April, I helped to lay
the foundation stone of the middle wall of the great tower of
Appleby Castle, called "Cæsar's Tower," to the end it might be
repaired again, and made habitable, if it pleased God (Is. lviii.
12), after it had stood without a roof or covering, or one
chamber habitable in it, since about 1567," etc. etc.</p>

<p>The following is Sarah Coleridge's criticism of the <a href="#SONG_AT_THE_FEAST_OF_BROUGHAM"><i>Song at the
Feast of Brougham Castle</i></a>, in the editorial note to her father's
<i>Biographia Literaria</i> (vol. ii. ch. ix. p. 152, ed. 1847):&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot">"The transitions and vicissitudes in this noble lyric I have
always thought rendered it one of the finest specimens of modern
subjective poetry which our age has seen. The ode commences
in a tone of high gratulation and festivity&mdash;a tone not only glad,
but <i>comparatively</i> even jocund and light-hearted. The Clifford
is restored to the home, the honours and estates of his ancestors.
Then it sinks and falls away to the remembrance of tribulation&mdash;times
of war and bloodshed, flight and terror, and hiding
away from the enemy&mdash;times of poverty and distress, when
the Clifford was brought, a little child, to the shelter of a
northern valley. After a while it emerges from those depths of
sorrow&mdash;gradually rises into a strain of elevated tranquillity and
contemplative rapture; through the power of imagination, the
beautiful and impressive aspects of nature are brought into
relationship with the spirit of him, whose fortunes and character
form the subject of the piece, and are represented as
gladdening and exalting it, whilst they keep it <i>pure and unspotted
from the world</i>. Suddenly the Poet is carried on with
greater animation and passion: he has returned to the point
whence he started&mdash;flung himself back into the tide of stirring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
life and moving events. All is to come over again, struggle
and conflict, chances and changes of war, victory and triumph,
overthrow and desolation. I know nothing, in lyric poetry,
more beautiful or affecting than the final transition from this
part of the ode, with its rapid metre, to the slow elegiac stanzas
at the end, when, from the warlike fervour and eagerness, the
jubilant strain which has just been described, the Poet passes
back into the sublime silence of Nature, gathering amid her
deep and quiet bosom a more subdued and solemn tenderness
than he had manifested before; it is as if from the heights of
the imaginative intellect, his spirit had retreated into the recesses
of a profoundly thoughtful Christian heart."</p>

<p>Professor Henry Reed said of this poem&mdash;"Had he never
written another ode, this alone would set him at the head of
the lyric poets of England."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<h2><a name="Year_1808" id="Year_1808"></a>1808</h2>


<p>The poems referring to Coleorton are all transferred to
the year 1807, and <i>The Force of Prayer</i> was written in that
year. Those composed in 1808 were few in number. With
the exception of <i>The White Doe of Rylstone</i>&mdash;to which additions
were made in that year&mdash;they include only the two sonnets
<i>Composed while the Author was engaged in writing a Tract,
occasioned by the Convention of Cintra</i>, and the fragment on
<i>George and Sarah Green</i>. The latter poem Wordsworth gave
to De Quincey, who published it in his "Recollections of
Grasmere," which appeared in <i>Tait's Edinburgh Magazine</i> in
September 1839; but it never found a place in any edition of
Wordsworth's own poems. In this edition it is printed in the
appendix to volume viii.</p>

<p>The reasons which have led me to assign <a href="#THE_WHITE_DOE_OF_RYLSTONE"><i>The White Doe of
Rylstone</i></a> to the year 1808, are stated in a note to the poem
(see <a href="#Page_191">p. 191</a>). I infer that it was practically finished in April
1808, because Dorothy Wordsworth, in a letter to Lady Beaumont,
dated April 20, 1808, says, "The poem is to be
published. Longman has consented&mdash;in spite of the odium
under which my brother labours as a poet&mdash;to give him 100
guineas for 1000 copies, according to his demand." She gives
no indication of the name of the poem referred to. As it must,
however, have been one which was to be published separately,
she can only refer to <a href="#THE_WHITE_DOE_OF_RYLSTONE"><i>The White Doe</i></a> or to <i>The Excursion</i>;
but the latter poem was not finished in 1808.</p>

<p>It is probable, from the remark made in a subsequent letter
to Lady Beaumont, February 1810, that Wordsworth intended
either to add to what he had written in 1808, or to alter some
passages before publication; or by "completing" the poem, he
may have meant simply adding the Dedication, which was
not written till 1815.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>All things considered, it seems the best arrangement that the
poems of 1808 should begin with <a href="#THE_WHITE_DOE_OF_RYLSTONE"><i>The White Doe of Rylstone</i></a>.
In the year 1891 I edited this poem for the Clarendon Press.
A few additional details have come to light since then, and are
introduced into the notes. S. T. Coleridge's criticism of the
poem in <i>Biographia Literaria</i>, vol. ii. chap. xxii. p. 176 (edition
1817), should be consulted.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p class="center">Composed 1807-10.&mdash;Published 1815</p>


<p class="center">ADVERTISEMENT</p>

<p>During the Summer of 1807, I visited, for the first time, the
beautiful country that surrounds Bolton Priory, in Yorkshire;
and the Poem of the <span class="smcap">White Doe</span>, founded upon a Tradition
connected with that place, was composed at the close of the
same year.&mdash;W. W.<a name="FNanchor_A_398" id="FNanchor_A_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_398" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p>

<p>[The earlier half of this poem was composed at Stockton-upon-Tees,
when Mrs. Wordsworth and I were on a visit to her
eldest brother, Mr. Hutchinson, at the close of the year 1807.
The country is flat, and the weather was rough. I was
accustomed every day to walk to and fro under the shelter of a
row of stacks, in a field at a small distance from the town, and
there poured forth my verses aloud as freely as they would
come. Mrs. Wordsworth reminds me that her brother stood
upon the punctilio of not sitting down to dinner till I joined
the party; and it frequently happened that I did not make my
appearance till too late, so that she was made uncomfortable.
I here beg her pardon for this and similar transgressions during
the whole course of our wedded life. To my beloved sister the
same apology is due.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>When, from the visit just mentioned, we returned to Town-end,
Grasmere, I proceeded with the poem; and it may be
worth while to note, as a caution to others who may cast their
eye on these memoranda, that the skin having been rubbed off
my heel by my wearing too tight a shoe, though I desisted from
walking, I found that the irritation of the wounded part was
kept up, by the act of composition, to a degree that made it
necessary to give my constitution a holiday. A rapid cure was
the consequence. Poetic excitement, when accompanied by
protracted labour in composition, has throughout my life brought
on more or less bodily derangement. Nevertheless, I am at
the close of my seventy-third year, in what may be called
excellent health; so that intellectual labour is not necessarily
unfavourable to longevity. But perhaps I ought here to add
that mine has been generally carried on out of doors.</p>

<p>Let me here say a few words of this poem in the way of
criticism. The subject being taken from feudal times has led
to its being compared to some of Walter Scott's poems that
belong to the same age and state of society. The comparison
is inconsiderate. Sir Walter pursued the customary and very
natural course of conducting an action, presenting various turns
of fortune, to some outstanding point on which the mind might
rest as a termination or catastrophe. The course I have
attempted to pursue is entirely different. Everything that is
attempted by the principal personages in <i>The White Doe</i> fails,
so far as its object is external and substantial. So far as it is
moral and spiritual it succeeds. The heroine of the poem knows
that her duty is not to interfere with the current of events,
either to forward or delay them, but</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i9h">to abide</span><br />
<span class="i2">The shock, and finally secure</span><br />
<span class="i2">O'er pain and grief a triumph pure.</span>
</div></div>

<p>This she does in obedience to her brother's injunction, as
most suitable to a mind and character that, under previous trials,
has been proved to accord with his. She achieves this not
without aid from the communication with the inferior Creature,
which often leads her thoughts to revolve upon the past with a
tender and humanising influence that exalts rather than depresses
her. The anticipated beatification, if I may so say, of her
mind, and the apotheosis of the companion of her solitude, are
the points at which the Poem aims, and constitute its legitimate
catastrophe, far too spiritual a one for instant or widely-spread
sympathy, but not, therefore, the less fitted to make a deep and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
permanent impression upon that class of minds who think and
feel more independently, than the many do, of the surfaces of
things and interests transitory, because belonging more to the
outward and social forms of life than to its internal spirit. How
insignificant a thing, for example, does personal prowess appear
compared with the fortitude of patience and heroic martyrdom;
in other words, with struggles for the sake of principle, in
preference to victory gloried in for its own sake.&mdash;I. F.]</p>

<p>The following is the full text of the first "note" to <a href="#THE_WHITE_DOE_OF_RYLSTONE"><i>The
White Doe of Rylstone</i></a>, published in the quarto edition of 1815.
The other notes to that edition are printed in this, at the foot

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"The Poem of <a href="#THE_WHITE_DOE_OF_RYLSTONE"><i>The White Doe of Rylstone</i></a> is founded on
a local tradition, and on the Ballad in Percy's Collection,
entitled <i>The Rising of the North</i>. The tradition is as
follows: 'About this time,' not long after the Dissolution, 'a
White Doe, say the aged people of the neighbourhood, long
continued to make a weekly pilgrimage from Rylstone over the
fells of Bolton, and was constantly found in the Abbey
Church-yard during divine service; after the close of which she
returned home as regularly as the rest of the congregation.'&mdash;Dr.
<span class="smcap">Whitaker's</span> <i>History of the Deanery of Craven</i>.&mdash;Rylstone
was the property and residence of the Nortons, distinguished in
that ill-advised and unfortunate Insurrection, which led me to
connect with this tradition the principal circumstances of their
fate, as recorded in the Ballad which I have thought it proper
to annex.</p>

<p class="center">
<i>The Rising in the North.</i><br />
</p>

<p>"The subject of this ballad is the great Northern Insurrection
in the 12th year of Elizabeth, 1569, which proved so fatal
to Thomas Percy, the seventh Earl of Northumberland.</p>

<p>"There had not long before been a secret negociation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
entered into between some of the Scottish and English nobility,
to bring about a marriage between Mary Q. of Scots, at
that time a prisoner in England, and the Duke of Norfolk, a
nobleman of excellent character. This match was proposed to
all the most considerable of the English nobility, and among
the rest to the Earls of Northumberland and Westmoreland,
two noblemen very powerful in the North. As it seemed to
promise a speedy and safe conclusion of the troubles in
Scotland, with many advantages to the crown of England, they
all consented to it, provided it should prove agreeable to Queen
Elizabeth. The Earl of Leicester (Elizabeth's favourite)
undertook to break the matter to her, but before he could find
an opportunity, the affair had come to her ears by other hands,
and she was thrown into a violent flame. The Duke of
Norfolk, with several of his friends, was committed to the
Tower, and summons were sent to the Northern Earls
instantly to make their appearance at court. It is said that the
Earl of Northumberland, who was a man of a mild and gentle
nature,<a name="FNanchor_XX_447" id="FNanchor_XX_447"></a><a href="#Footnote_XX_447" class="fnanchor">[XX]</a> was deliberating with himself whether he should not
obey the message, and rely upon the Queen's candour and
clemency, when he was forced into desperate measures by a
sudden report at midnight, Nov. 14, that a party of his enemies
were come to seize his person. The Earl was then at his house
at Topcliffe in Yorkshire. When, rising hastily out of bed, he
withdrew to the Earl of Westmoreland at Brancepeth, where
the country came in to them, and pressed them to take up arms
in their own defence. They accordingly set up their standards,
declaring their intent was to restore the ancient Religion, to
get the succession of the crown firmly settled, and to prevent
the destruction of the ancient nobility, etc. Their common
banner (on which was displayed the cross, together with the
five wounds of Christ) was borne by an ancient gentleman, Richard
Norton, Esquire, who, with his sons (among whom, Christopher,
Marmaduke, and Thomas, are expressly named by Camden),
distinguished himself on this occasion. Having entered
Durham, they tore the Bible, etc., and caused mass to be said
there; they then marched on to Clifford-moor near Wetherby,
where they mustered their men.... The two Earls, who
spent their large estates in hospitality, and were extremely
beloved on that account, were masters of little ready money;
the E. of Northumberland bringing with him only 8000<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
crowns, and the E. of Westmoreland nothing at all, for the
subsistence of their forces, they were not able to march to
London, as they had at first intended. In these circumstances,
Westmoreland began so visibly to despond, that many of his
men slunk away, though Northumberland still kept up his
resolution, and was master of the field till December 13,
when the Earl of Sussex, accompanied with Lord Hunsden and
others, having marched out of York at the head of a large body
of forces, and being followed by a still larger army under the
command of Ambrose Dudley, Earl of Warwick, the insurgents
retreated northward towards the borders, and there dismissing
their followers, made their escape into Scotland. Though this
insurrection had been suppressed with so little bloodshed, the
Earl of Sussex and Sir George Bowes, marshal of the army,
put vast numbers to death by martial law, without any regular
trial. The former of these caused at Durham sixty-three
constables to be hanged at once. And the latter made his
boast, that for sixty miles in length, and forty in breadth,
betwixt Newcastle and Wetherby, there was hardly a town or
village wherein he had not executed some of the inhabitants.
This exceeds the cruelties practised in the West after
Monmouth's rebellion.</p>

Guthrie, Carte, and Rapin; it agrees, in most particulars, with

<p>"'Bolton Priory,' says Dr. Whitaker in his excellent book&mdash;<i>The
History and Antiquities of the Deanery of Craven</i>&mdash;'stands
upon a beautiful curvature of the Wharf, on a level
sufficiently elevated to protect it from inundations, and low
enough for every purpose of picturesque effect.</p>

<p>"'Opposite to the East window of the Priory Church, the
river washes the foot of a rock nearly perpendicular, and of the
richest purple, where several of the mineral beds, which break
out, instead of maintaining their usual inclination to the horizon,
are twisted by some inconceivable process, into undulating and
spiral lines. To the South all is soft and delicious; the eye
reposes upon a few rich pastures, a moderate reach of the river,
sufficiently tranquil to form a mirror to the sun, and the
bounding hills beyond, neither too near nor too lofty to exclude,
even in winter, any portion of his rays.</p>

<p>"'But, after all, the glories of Bolton are on the North.
Whatever the most fastidious taste could require to constitute a
perfect landscape is not only found here, but in its proper place.
In front, and immediately under the eye, is a smooth expanse
of park-like enclosure, spotted with native elm, ash, etc. of the
finest growth: on the right a skirting oak wood, with jutting
points of grey rock; on the left a rising copse. Still forward
are seen the aged groves of Bolton Park, the growth of centuries;
and farther yet, the barren and rocky distances of Simon-seat
and Barden Fell contrasted with the warmth, fertility, and
luxuriant foliage of the valley below.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>"'About half a mile above Bolton the Valley closes, and
either side of the Wharf is overhung by solemn woods, from
which huge perpendicular masses of grey rock jut out at
intervals.</p>

<p>"'This sequestered scene was almost inaccessible till of late,
that ridings have been cut on both sides of the River, and the
most interesting points laid open by judicious thinnings in the
woods. Here a tributary stream rushes from a waterfall, and
bursts through a woody glen to mingle its waters with the
Wharf: there the Wharf itself is nearly lost in a deep cleft in
the rock, and next becomes a horned flood enclosing a woody
island&mdash;sometimes it reposes for a moment, and then resumes
its native character, lively, irregular, and impetuous.</p>

<p>"'The cleft mentioned above is the tremendous <span class="smcap">Strid</span>.
This chasm, being incapable of receiving the winter floods, has
formed, on either side, a broad strand of naked gritstone full of
rock-basons, or "pots of the Linn," which bear witness to the
restless impetuosity of so many Northern torrents. But, if here
Wharf is lost to the eye, it amply repays another sense by its
deep and solemn roar, like "the Voice of the angry Spirit of
the Waters," heard far above and beneath, amidst the silence
of the surrounding woods.</p>

<p>"'The terminating object of the landscape is the remains of
Barden Tower, interesting from their form and situation, and
still more so from the recollections which they excite.'"</p>

<p><a href="#THE_WHITE_DOE_OF_RYLSTONE"><i>The White Doe of Rylstone</i></a> has been assigned chronologically
to the year 1808; although part of it&mdash;probably the larger half&mdash;was
written during the autumn of the previous year, and it
remained unfinished in 1810, while the Dedication was not
written till 1815. In the Fenwick note, Wordsworth tells us
that the "earlier half" was written at Stockton-on-Tees "at
the close" of 1807, and "proceeded with" at Dove Cottage,
after his return to Grasmere, which was in April 1808. But
on the 28th February, 1810, Dorothy Wordsworth, writing from
Allan Bank to Lady Beaumont, says, "Before my brother
turns to any other labour, I hope he will have finished three
books of <i>The Recluse</i>. He seldom writes less than 50 lines
every day. After this task is finished he hopes to complete
<a href="#THE_WHITE_DOE_OF_RYLSTONE"><i>The White Doe</i></a>, and proud should we all be if it should be
honoured by a frontispiece from the pencil of Sir George
Beaumont. Perhaps this is not impossible, if you come into
the north next summer."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>A frontispiece was drawn by Sir George Beaumont for
the quarto edition of 1815.</p>

<p>When part of the poem was finished, Wordsworth showed it
to Southey; and Southey, writing to Walter Scott, in February
1808, said,&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot">"Wordsworth has just completed a most masterly poem
upon the fate of the Nortons; two or three lines in the old
ballad of <i>The Rising of the North</i> gave him the hint. The
story affected me more deeply than I wish to be affected;
younger readers, however, will not object to the depth of the
distress, and nothing was ever more ably treated. He is looking,
too, for a narrative subject, pitched in a lower key."</p>

<p>One of the most interesting letters of S. T. Coleridge to
Wordsworth is an undated one, sent from London in the spring
of 1808, containing a characteristic criticism of <a href="#THE_WHITE_DOE_OF_RYLSTONE"><i>The White Doe</i></a>.
The Wordsworth family had asked Coleridge to discuss the
subject of the publication of the poem with the Longmans'
firm. It is more than probable that it was Coleridge's criticism
of the structural defects in the poem, that led Wordsworth to
postpone its publication. The following is part of the
letter:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"... In my reperusals of the poem, it seemed always to
strike on my feeling as well as judgment, that if there were any
serious defect, it consisted in a disproportion of the Accidents
to the spiritual Incidents; and, closely connected with this,&mdash;if
it be not indeed the same,&mdash;that Emily is indeed talked of,
and once appears, but neither speaks nor acts, in all the first
three-fourths of the poem. Then, as the outward interest of
the poem is in favour of the old man's religious feelings, and
the filial heroism of his band of sons, it seemed to require
something in order to place the two protestant malcontents of
the family in a light that made them beautiful as well as
virtuous. In short, to express it far more strongly than I
mean or think, in order (in the present anguish of my spirits)
to be able to express it at all, that three-fourths of the work
is everything rather <i>than</i> Emily; and then, the last&mdash;almost a
separate and doubtless an exquisite poem&mdash;wholly <i>of</i> Emily.
The whole of the rest, and the delivering up of the family
by Francis, I never ceased to find, not only comparatively
heavy, but to me quite obscure as to Francis's motives. On
the few, to whom, within my acquaintance, the poem has been
read, either by yourself or me (I have, I believe, read it only at
the Beaumonts'), it produced the same effect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>"Now I have conceived two little incidents, the introduction
of which, joined to a little abridgment, and lyrical precipitation
of the last half of the third, I had thought would have removed
this defect, so seeming to me, and bring to a finer balance the
<i>business</i> with the <i>action</i> of the tale. But after my receipt of
your letter, concerning Lamb's censures, I felt my courage fail,
and that what I deemed a harmonizing would disgust you as a
<i>materialization</i> of the plan, and appear to you like insensibility
to the power of the history in the mind. Not that I should
have shrunk back from the mere fear of giving transient pain,
and a temporary offence, from the want of sympathy of feeling
and coincidence of opinions. I rather envy than blame that
deep interest in a production, which is inevitable perhaps, and
certainly not dishonourable to such as feel poetry their calling
and their duty, and which no man would find much fault with
if the object, instead of a poem, were a large estate or a title.
It appears to me to become a foible only when the poet denies,
or is unconscious of its existence, but I did not deem myself in
such a state of mind as to entitle me to rely on my own opinion
when opposed to yours, from the heat and bustle of these disgusting
lectures.</p>

<p class="center" style="letter-spacing: 3em;">&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;</p>

<p>"From most of these causes I was suffering, so as not to
allow me any rational confidence in my opinions when contrary
to yours, which had been formed in calmness and on long reflection.
Then I received your sister's letter, stating the wish
that I would give up the thought of proposing the means of
correction, and merely point out the things to be corrected,
which&mdash;as they could be of no great consequence&mdash;you might
do in a day or two, and the publication of the poem&mdash;for the
immediacy of which she expressed great anxiety&mdash;be no longer
retarded. The merely verbal <i>alteranda</i> did appear to me very
few and trifling. From your letter on L&mdash;&mdash;, I concluded that
you would not have the incidents and action interfered with,
and therefore I sent it off; but soon retracted it, in order to
note down the single words and phrases that I disliked in the
books, after the two first, as there would be time to receive
your opinion of them during the printing of the two first, in
which I saw nothing amiss, except the one passage we altered
together, and the two lines which I scratched out, because you
yourself were doubtful. Mrs. Shepherd told me that she had
felt them exactly as I did&mdash;namely, as interrupting the spirit of
the continuous tranquil motion of <a href="#THE_WHITE_DOE_OF_RYLSTONE"><i>The White Doe</i></a>."</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>It will be seen from this letter that Wordsworth had gone
over the poem with Coleridge, and that they had altered some
passages "together"; that Coleridge had read a copy of it sent
to the Beaumonts, doubtless at Dunmow in Essex; that he
had thought of a plan by which the poem could be immensely
improved, both by addition and subtraction; but that hearing
from Wordsworth, or more probably from his sister Dorothy,
that Charles Lamb had also criticised its structure, he gave up
his intention of sending to his friend suggestions, which
evidently implied a radical alteration of "the incidents and
action" of the tale. It would have been extremely interesting
to know how the author of <i>Christabel</i> and <i>The Ancient Mariner</i>
proposed to recast <a href="#THE_WHITE_DOE_OF_RYLSTONE"><i>The White Doe of Rylstone</i></a>. It is, alas!
impossible for posterity to know this, although it is not difficult
to conjecture the line which the alterations would take.
Wordsworth's genius was not great in construction, as in imagination;
and he valued a story only as giving him a "point
of departure" for a flight of fancy or of idealization. Early in
1808 he wrote to Walter Scott asking him for facts about the
Norton family. Scott supplied him with them, and the following
was Wordsworth's reply.</p>

<p class="quotdate">
"<span class="smcap">Grasmere</span>, May 14, 1808.<br />
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="indentsm">"<span class="smcap">My dear Scott</span>&mdash;Thank you for the interesting particulars
about the Nortons. I like them much for their own
sakes; but so far from being serviceable to my poem, they
would stand in the way of it, as I have followed (as I was in
duty bound to do) the traditionary and common historic account.
Therefore I shall say, in this case, a plague upon your industrious
antiquarians, that have put my fine story to confusion."</p>
</div>

<p>From the "advertisement" which Wordsworth prefixed to
his edition of 1815, I infer that the larger part of the poem
was written at Stockton. In it he says that "the Poem of
<a href="#THE_WHITE_DOE_OF_RYLSTONE"><i>The White Doe</i></a> was composed at the close of the year" (1807).
This is an illustration of the vague manner in which he was
in the habit of assigning dates. The Fenwick note, and the
evidence of his sister's letter, is conclusive; although the fact
that <a href="#THE_FORCE_OF_PRAYERA"><i>The Force of Prayer</i></a>&mdash;written in 1807&mdash;is called in
the Fenwick note "an appendage to <a href="#THE_WHITE_DOE_OF_RYLSTONE"><i>The White Doe</i></a>," is
further confirmation of the belief that the principal part of
the latter poem was finished in 1807. All things considered,
<a href="#THE_WHITE_DOE_OF_RYLSTONE"><i>The White Doe of Rylstone</i></a> may be most conveniently placed
after the poems belonging to the year 1807, and before those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
known to have been written in 1808; while <a href="#THE_FORCE_OF_PRAYERA"><i>The Force of
Prayer</i></a> naturally follows it.</p>

<p>The poem&mdash;first published in quarto in 1815&mdash;was scarcely
altered in the editions of 1820, 1827, and 1832. In 1837,
however, it was revised throughout, and in that year the text
was virtually settled; the subsequent changes being few and
insignificant, while those introduced in 1837 were numerous
and important. A glance at the foot-notes will show that
many passages were entirely rewritten in that year, and that
a good many lines of the earlier text were altogether omitted.
All the poems were subjected to minute revision in 1836-37;
but few, if any, were more thoroughly recast, and improved,
in that year than <a href="#THE_WHITE_DOE_OF_RYLSTONE"><i>The White Doe of Rylstone</i></a>. As a sample
of the best kind of changes&mdash;where a new thought was added
to the earlier text with admirable felicity&mdash;compare the lines
in canto vii., as it stood in 1815, when the Lady Emily
first saw the White Doe at the old Hall of Rylstone, after her
terrible losses and desolation&mdash;</p>

<p>In the "Reminiscences" of Wordsworth&mdash;written by the Hon.
Mr. Justice Coleridge for the late Bishop of Lincoln's <i>Memoirs</i>
of his uncle&mdash;the following occurs. (See vol. ii. p. 311.)
"His conversation was on critical subjects, arising out of his
attempts to alter his poems. He said he considered <a href="#THE_WHITE_DOE_OF_RYLSTONE"><i>The White
Doe</i></a> as, in conception, the highest work he had ever produced.
The mere physical action was all unsuccessful: but the true
action of the poem was spiritual&mdash;the subduing of the will,
and all inferior fancies, to the perfect purifying and spiritualizing
of the intellectual nature; while the Doe, by connection
with Emily, is raised as it were from its mere animal nature
into something mysterious and saint-like. He said he should
devote much labour to perfecting the execution of it in the
mere business parts, in which, from anxiety 'to get on' with
the more important parts, he was sensible that imperfections
had crept in which gave the style a feebleness of character."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>From this conversation&mdash;which took place in 1836&mdash;it will
be seen that Wordsworth knew very well that there were feeble
passages in the earlier editions; and that, in the thorough
revision which he gave to all his poems in 1836-37, this one was
specially singled out for "much labour." The result is seen
by a glance at the changes of the text.</p>

<p>The notes appended by Wordsworth to the edition of 1815
explain some of the historical and topographical allusions in the
poem. To these the following editorial notes may be added&mdash;</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>In 1153, the canons of the Augustinian Priory at Embsay,
near Skipton, were removed to Bolton, by William Fitz Duncan,
and his wife, Cecilia de Romillé, who granted it by charter
in exchange for the Manors of Skibdem and Stretton. The
establishment at Bolton consisted of a prior and about 15
canons, over 200 persons (including servants and lay brethren)
being supported at Bolton. During the Scottish raids of the
fourteenth century, the prior and canons had frequently to
retreat to Skipton for safety. In 1542 the site of the priory
and demesnes were sold to Harry Clifford, first Earl of Cumberland.
From the last Earl of Cumberland it passed to the
second Earl of Cork, and then to the Devonshire family, to
which it still belongs. The following is part of the excellent
account of the Priory, given in Murray's <i>Yorkshire</i>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"The chief relic of the Priory is the church, the nave of
which after the Dissolution was retained as the chapel of this
so-called 'Saxon-Cure.' This nave remains perfect, but the
rest of the church is in complete ruin. The lower walls of the
choir are Trans-Norman, and must have been built immediately
after (if not before) the removal from Embsay. The upper
walls and windows (the tracery of which is destroyed) are
decorated. The nave is early English, and decorated; and
the original west front remains with an elaborate Perpendicular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
front of excellent design, intended as the base of a western
tower, which was never finished.... The nave (which has
been restored under the direction of Crace)&mdash;the</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3h">... "'One protected part</span><br />
<span class="i2">In the shattered fabric's heart,'</span>
</div></div>

<p>is Early English on the south side, and Decorated on the
north.... At the end of the nave aisle, enclosed by a
Perpendicular screen, is a chantry, founded by the Mauleverers;
and below it is the vault, in which, according to tradition,
the Claphams of Beamsley and their ancestors the Mauleverers
were interred upright&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"'Pass, pass who will, yon chantry door;</span><br />

<span class="i2">There, face by face, and hand by hand,</span><br />
<span class="i2">The Claphams and Mauleverers stand.'</span>
</div></div>

<p>"Whitaker, however, could never see this 'griesly sight' through
the chink in the floor; and it is perhaps altogether traditional.
The ruined portion of the church is entirely Decorated, with
the exception of the lower walls of the choir. The transepts
had eastern aisles. The north transept is nearly perfect: the
south retains only its western wall, in which are two decorated
windows. The piers of a central tower remain; but at what
period it was destroyed, or if it was ever completed, is uncertain.
The choir is long and aisleless. Some fragments of
tracery remain in the south window, which was a very fine
one. Below the window runs a Transitional Norman arcade.
Some portions of tomb-slabs remain in the choir.... The
church-yard lies on the north side of the ruins. This has been
made classic ground by Wordsworth's poem."</p>

Upper Wharfedale at Barden. "Grey tower-like projections of

"one of six which existed in different parts of Barden Forest.
The Shepherd-lord, whose early life among the Cumberland
Fells led him to seek quiet and retirement after his restoration,
preferred Barden to his greater castles, and enlarged

</div></div></div>

<p>The circumstances which led to the Rising in the North,
and the chief incidents of that unfortunate episode in English
history, are traced in detail by Mr. Froude, in the fifty-third
chapter of his <i>History of England</i>. They are also summarized,
in a lecture on <a href="#THE_WHITE_DOE_OF_RYLSTONE"><i>The White Doe of Rylstone</i></a>, by the late Principal
Shairp, in his <i>Aspects of Poetry</i>, from which the following
passage is an extract (pp. 346-48).</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"The incidents on which the <a href="#THE_WHITE_DOE_OF_RYLSTONE"><i>White Doe</i></a> is founded belong
to the year 1569, the twelfth of Queen Elizabeth.</p>

<p>"It is well known that as soon as Queen Mary of Scotland
was imprisoned in England, she became the centre around
which gathered all the intrigues which were then on foot,
not only in England but throughout Catholic Europe, to dethrone
the Protestant Queen Elizabeth. Abroad, the Catholic world
was collecting all its strength to crush the heretical island.
The bigot Pope, Pius V., with the dark intriguer, Philip II.
of Spain, and the savage Duke of Alva, were ready to pour
their forces on the shores of England.</p>

<p>"At home, a secret negotiation for a marriage between
Queen Mary and the Duke of Norfolk had received the approval
of many of the chief English nobles. The Queen discovered
the plot, threw Norfolk and some of his friends into the Tower,
and summoned Percy, Earl of Northumberland, and Neville,
Earl of Westmoreland, immediately to appear at court. These<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
two earls were known to be holding secret communications with
Mary, and longing to see the old faith restored.</p>

<p>"On receiving the summons, Northumberland at once withdrew
to Brancepeth Castle, a stronghold of the Earl of Westmoreland.
Straightway all their vassals rose, and gathered
round the two great earls. The whole of the North was in
arms. A proclamation went forth that they intended to restore
the ancient religion, to settle the succession to the crown, and
to prevent the destruction of the old nobility. As they marched
forward they were joined by all the strength of the Yorkshire
dales, and, among others, by a gentleman of ancient name,
Richard Norton, accompanied by eight brave sons. He came
bearing the common banner, called the Banner of the Five
Wounds, because on it was displayed the Cross with the five
wounds of our Lord. The insurgents entered Durham, tore the
Bible, caused mass to be said in the cathedral, and then set
forward as for York. Changing their purpose on the way, they
turned aside to lay siege to Barnard Castle, which was held by
Sir George Bowes for the Queen. While they lingered there
for eleven days, Sussex marched against them from York, and
the earls, losing heart, retired towards the Border, and disbanded
their forces, which were left to the vengeance of the
enemy, while they themselves sought refuge in Scotland.
Northumberland, after a confinement of several years in Loch
Leven Castle, was betrayed by the Scots to the English, and
put to death. Westmoreland died an exile in Flanders, the
last of the ancient house of the Nevilles, earls of Westmoreland.
Norton, with his eight sons, fell into the hands of Sussex, and
all suffered death at York. It is the fate of this ancient family
on which Wordsworth's poem is founded."</p>
</div>

<p>This statement as to the fate of Norton's sons, however, is
not borne out by the historians. Mr. Froude says (<i>History of
England</i>, chap. 53), "Two sons of old Norton and two of his
brothers, after long and close cross-questioning in the Tower,
were tried and convicted at Westminster. Two of these
Nortons were afterwards pardoned. Two, one of whom was
Christopher, the poor youth who had been bewildered by the
fair eyes of the Queen of Scots at Bolton, were put to death at
Tyburn, with the usual cruelties."</p>

<p>Little now remains of Rylstone Hall but the site. "Some
garden flowers still, as when Whitaker wrote, mark the site of
the pleasaunce. The house fell into decay immediately after
the attainder of the Nortons; and, with the estates here,
remained in the hands of the Crown until the second year of
James I., when they were granted to the Earl of Cumberland.
Although Wordsworth makes the Nortons raise their famous
banner here, they assembled their followers in fact at Ripon
(November 18, 1569), but their Rylstone tenants rose with them."</p>

<p>Naworth Castle, at the head of the vale of Llanercort, in the
Gilsland district of Cumberland, was the seat of the Dacres from
the reign of Edward III. George, Lord Dacre, the last heir-male
of that family, was killed in 1559; and Lord William
Howard (the third son of Thomas, Duke of Norfolk), who was
made Warden of the Borders by Queen Elizabeth, and did much
to introduce order and good government into the district,
married the heiress of the Dacre family, and succeeded to the
castle and estate of Naworth. The arms over the entrance of
the castle are the Howard's and Dacre's quartered.</p>

<p>The Battle of the Standard was fought in 1137.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"One gleam of national glory broke the darkness of the
time. King David of Scotland stood first among the partizans
of his kinswoman Matilda, and on the accession of Stephen his
army crossed the border to enforce her claim. The pillage and
cruelties of the wild tribes of Galloway and the Highlands
roused the spirit of the north; baron and freeman gathered at
York round Archbishop Thurstan, and marched to the field of
Northallerton to await the foe. The sacred banners of St.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
Cuthbert of Durham, St. Peter of York, St. John of Beverley,
and St. Wilfrid of Ripon, hung from a pole fixed in a four-wheeled
car, which stood in the centre of the host. 'I who
wear no armour,' shouted the chief of the Galwegians, 'will go
as far this day as any one with breastplate of mail;' his men
charged with wild shouts of 'Albin, Albin,' and were followed
by the Norman knighthood of the Lowlands. The rout, however,
was complete; the fierce hordes dashed in vain against
the close English ranks around the Standard, and the whole
army fled in confusion to Carlisle." (J. R. Green's <i>Short
History of the English People</i>, p. 99.)</p>

<p class="blockquot">"Some mounds near the tower are thought to have been
used as butts for archers; and there are traces of a strong wall,
running from the tower to the edge of a deep glen, whence
a ditch runs to another ravine. This was once a pond, used
by the Nortons for detaining the red deer within the township
of Rylstone, which they asserted was not within the forest of
Skipton, and consequently that the Cliffords had no right to
hunt therein. The Cliffords eventually became lords of all the
Norton lands here."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>In January 1816, Wordsworth wrote thus to his friend
Archdeacon Wrangham.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"Of <a href="#THE_WHITE_DOE_OF_RYLSTONE"><i>The White Doe</i></a> I have little to say, but that I hope
it will be acceptable to the intelligent, for whom alone it is
written. It starts from a high point of imagination, and comes
round, through various wanderings of that faculty, to a still
higher&mdash;nothing less than the apotheosis of the animal who
gives the first of the two titles to the poem. And as the poem
thus begins and ends with pure and lofty imagination, every
motive and impetus that actuates the persons introduced is from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
the same source; a kindred spirit pervades, and is intended to
harmonise, the whole. Throughout objects (the banner, for
instance) derive their influence, not from properties inherent in
them, not from what they <i>are</i> actually in themselves, but from
such as are <i>bestowed</i> upon them by the minds of those who are
conversant with, or affected by, these objects. Thus the poetry,
if there be any in the work, proceeds, as it ought to do, from
the <i>soul of man</i>, communicating its creative energies to the
images of the external world."</p>

<p>The following is from a letter to Southey in the same year:&mdash;"Do
you know who reviewed <a href="#THE_WHITE_DOE_OF_RYLSTONE"><i>The White Doe</i></a> in the
'Quarterly'? After having asserted that Mr. W. uses his words
without any regard to their sense, the writer says that on no other
principle can he explain that Emily is <i>always</i> called 'the
consecrated Emily.' Now, the name Emily occurs just fifteen
times in the poem; and out of these fifteen, the epithet is
attached to it <i>once</i>, and that for the express purpose of recalling
the scene in which she had been consecrated by her brother's
solemn adjuration, that she would fulfil her destiny, and become
a soul,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"'By force of sorrows high</span><br />
<span class="i2">Uplifted to the purest sky</span><br />
<span class="i2">Of undisturbed mortality.'</span>
</div></div>

<p>The point upon which the whole moral interest of the piece
hinges, when that speech is closed, occurs in this line,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"'He kissed the consecrated Maid;'</span>
</div></div>

<p>And to bring back this to the reader, I repeated the epithet."</p>

<p>In a letter to Wordsworth about <i>The Waggoner</i>, Charles
Lamb wrote, June 7, 1819, "I re-read <a href="#THE_WHITE_DOE_OF_RYLSTONE"><i>The White Doe of
Rylstone</i></a>; the title should be always written at length, as
Mary Sabilla Novello, a very nice woman of our acquaintance,
always signs hers at the bottom of the shortest note.... Manning
had just sent it home, and it came as fresh to me as the
immortal creature it speaks of. M. sent it home with a note,
having this passage in it: 'I cannot help writing to you while I
am reading Wordsworth's poem.... 'Tis broad, noble, poetical,
with a masterly scanning of human actions, absolutely above
common readers.'" (See <i>The Letters of Charles Lamb</i>, edited
by Alfred Ainger, vol. ii. pp. 25, 26.)</p>

<p>Henry Crabb Robinson's judgment, as given in his <i>Diary</i>,
June 1815, is interesting. (See vol. i. p. 484.)</p>

<p>The following is from Principal Shairp's estimate of <a href="#THE_WHITE_DOE_OF_RYLSTONE"><i>The
White Doe of Rylstone</i></a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span> in his Oxford Lectures, <i>Aspects of Poetry</i>
(chapter xii. pp. 373-76). "What is it that gives to it" (the
poem) "its chief power and charm? Is it not the imaginative
use which the poet has made of the White Doe? With her
appearance the poem opens, with her re-appearance it closes.
And the passages in which she is introduced are radiant with
the purest light of poetry. A mere floating tradition she was,
which the historian of Craven had preserved. How much does
the poet bring out of how little! It was a high stroke of genius
to seize on this slight traditionary incident, and make it the
organ of so much. What were the objects which he had to
describe and blend into one harmonious whole. They were
these:</p>

<p>"1. The last expiring gleam of feudal chivalry, ending in
the ruin of an ancient race, and the desolation of an ancestral
home.</p>

<p>"2. The sole survivor, purified and exalted by the sufferings
she had to undergo.</p>

<p>"3. The pathos of the decaying sanctities of Bolton, after
wrong and outrage, abandoned to the healing of nature and time.</p>

<p>"4. Lastly, the beautiful scenery of pastoral Wharfdale,
and of the fells around Bolton, which blend so well with these
affecting memories.</p>

<p>"All these were before him&mdash;they had melted into his
imagination, and waited to be woven into one harmonious
creation. He takes the White Doe, and makes her the exponent,
the symbol, the embodiment of them all. The one central aim&mdash;to
represent the beatification of the heroine&mdash;how was this to
be attained? Had it been a drama, the poet would have made
the heroine give forth in speeches, her hidden mind and character.
But this was a romantic narrative. Was the poet to make her
soliloquise, analyse her own feelings, lay bare her heart in
metaphysical monologue? This might have been done by some
modern poets, but it was not Wordsworth's way of exhibiting
character, reflective though he was. When he analyses feelings
they are generally his own, not those of his characters. To
shadow forth that which is invisible, the sanctity of Emily's
chastened soul, he lays hold of this sensible image&mdash;a creature,
the purest, most innocent, most beautiful in the whole realm of
nature&mdash;and makes her the vehicle in which he embodies the
saintliness which is a thing invisible. It is the hardest of all
tasks to make spiritual things sensuous, without degrading them.
I know not where this difficulty has been more happily met;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
for we are made to feel that, before the poem closes, the Doe
has ceased to be a mere animal, or a physical creature at all, but
in the light of the poet's imagination, has been transfigured into
a heavenly apparition&mdash;a type of all that is pure, and affecting,
and saintly. And not only the chastened soul of her mistress,
but the beautiful Priory of Bolton, the whole Vale of Wharfe,
and all the surrounding scenery, are illumined by the glory
which she makes; her presence irradiates them all with a beauty
and an interest more than the eye discovers. Seen through
her as an imaginative transparency, they become spiritualized;
in fact, she and they alike become the symbol and expression
of the sentiment which pervades the poem&mdash;a sentiment broad
and deep as the world. And yet, any one who visits these
scenes, in a mellow autumnal day, will feel that she is no alien
or adventitious image, imported by the caprice of the poet, but
altogether native to the place, one which gathers up and concentrates
all the undefined spirit and sentiment which lie spread
around it. She both glorifies the scenery by her presence, and
herself seems to be a natural growth of the scenery, so that it
finds in her its most appropriate utterance. This power of
imagination to divine and project the very corporeal image
which suits and expresses the image of a scene, Wordsworth
has many times shown....</p>

<p>"And so the poem has no definite end, but passes off, as it
were, into the illimitable. It rises out of the perturbations of
time and transitory things, and, passing upward itself, takes
our thoughts with it to calm places and eternal sunshine."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

follows the Dedication of the poem to Mrs. Wordsworth, is taken from the
tragedy of <i>The Borderers</i>, act <span class="allcapsc">III.</span> line 405 (vol. i. p. 187). In the
prefatory note to <i>The Borderers</i>&mdash;published in 1842&mdash;Wordsworth says he
would not have made use of these lines in <a href="#THE_WHITE_DOE_OF_RYLSTONE"><i>The White Doe of Rylstone</i></a> if
he could have foreseen the time when he would be induced to publish the
tragedy. It is signed M. S. in the 1837-43 editions.
</p><p>
In a note to the edition of 1837, he says, "'Action is transitory,' etc.
This and the five lines that follow were either read or recited by me,
more than thirty years since, to the late Mr. Hazlitt, who quoted some
expressions in them (imperfectly remembered) in a work of his published
several years ago."
</p><p>
In the quarto edition of 1815 the following lines precede the extract
from Lord Bacon; and in the edition of 1820 they follow it. In 1827 they
were transferred to the "Miscellaneous Sonnets."

wants this ornament: but the Poem, according to the imagination of the
Poet, is composed in Queen Elizabeth's time. "Formerly," says Dr.
Whitaker, "over the Transept was a tower. This is proved not only from
the mention of bells at the Dissolution, when they could have had no
other place, but from the pointed roof of the choir, which must have

be found one, entitled, <i>Song at the Feast of Brougham Castle, upon the
Restoration of Lord Clifford, the Shepherd, to the Estates and Honours
of his Ancestors</i>. To that Poem is annexed an account of this personage
[p. 89], chiefly extracted from Burn's and Nicholson's History of
Cumberland and Westmoreland. It gives me pleasure to add these further
particulars concerning him from Dr. Whitaker, who says, "he retired to
the solitude of Barden, where he seems to have enlarged the tower out of
a common keeper's lodge, and where he found a retreat equally favourable
to taste, to instruction, and to devotion. The narrow limits of his
residence shew that he had learned to despise the pomp of greatness, and
that a small train of servants could suffice him, who had lived to the
age of thirty a servant himself. I think this nobleman resided here
almost entirely when in Yorkshire, for all his charters which I have
seen are dated at Barden.
</p><p>
"His early habits, and the want of those artificial measures of time
which even shepherds now possess, had given him a turn for observing the
motions of the heavenly bodies, and, having purchased such an apparatus
as could then be procured, he amused and informed himself by those
pursuits, with the aid of the Canons of Bolton, some of whom are said to
have been well versed in what was then known of the science.
</p><p>
"I suspect this nobleman to have been sometimes occupied in a more
visionary pursuit, and probably in the same company.
</p><p>
"For, from the family evidences, I have met with two MSS. on the subject
of Alchemy, which, from the character, spelling, etc., may almost
certainly be referred to the reign of Henry the Seventh. If these were
originally deposited with the MSS. of the Cliffords, it might have been
for the use of this nobleman. If they were brought from Bolton at the
Dissolution, they must have been the work of those Canons whom he almost
exclusively conversed with.
</p><p>
"In these peaceful employments Lord Clifford spent the whole reign of
Henry the Seventh, and the first years of his son. But in the year 1513,
when almost sixty years old, he was appointed to a principal command
over the army which fought at Flodden, and shewed that the military
genius of the family had neither been chilled in him by age, nor
extinguished by habits of peace.
</p><p>
"He survived the battle of Flodden ten years, and died April 23d, 1523,
aged about 70. I shall endeavour to appropriate to him a tomb, vault,
and chantry, in the choir of the church of Bolton, as I should be sorry
to believe that he was deposited when dead at a distance from the place
which in his life-time he loved so well.
</p><p>
"By his last will he appointed his body to be interred at Shap if he
died in Westmoreland; or at Bolton if he died in Yorkshire."
</p><p>
With respect to the Canons of Bolton, Dr. Whitaker shews from MSS. that
not only alchemy but astronomy was a favourite pursuit with them.&mdash;W. W.

begun, the 17th day of October, <i>anno</i> 1346, there did appear to John
Fosser, then Prior of the abbey of Durham, a Vision, commanding him to
take the holy Corporax-cloth, wherewith St. Cuthbert did cover the
chalice when he used to say mass, and to put the same holy relique like
to a banner-cloth upon the point of a spear, and the next morning to go
and repair to a place on the west side of the city of Durham, called the
Red Hills, where the Maid's Bower wont to be, and there to remain and
abide till the end of the battle. To which vision, the Prior obeying,
and taking the same for a revelation of God's grace and mercy by the
mediation of holy St. Cuthbert, did accordingly the next morning, with
the monks of the said abbey, repair to the said Red Hills, and there
most devoutly humbling and prostrating themselves in prayer for the
victory in the said battle: (a great multitude of the Scots running and
pressing by them, with intention to have spoiled them, yet had no power
to commit any violence under such holy persons, so occupied in prayer,
being protected and defended by the mighty Providence of Almighty God,
and by the mediation of Holy St. Cuthbert, and the presence of the holy
relique). And, after many conflicts and warlike exploits there had and
done between the English men and the King of Scots and his company, the
said battle ended, and the victory was obtained, to the great overthrow
and confusion of the Scots, their enemies: And then the said Prior and
monks, accompanied with Ralph Lord Nevil, and John Nevil his son, and
the Lord Percy, and many other nobles of England, returned home and went
to the abbey church, there joining in hearty prayer and thanksgiving to
God and holy St. Cuthbert for the victory atchieved that day."
</p><p>
This battle was afterwards called the Battle of Neville's Cross from the
following circumstance:&mdash;
</p><p>
"On the west side of the city of Durham, where two roads pass each
other, a most notable, famous, and goodly cross of stone-work was
erected, and set up to the honour of God for the victory there obtained
in the field of battle, and known by the name of Nevil's Cross, and
built at the sole cost of the Lord Ralph Nevil, one of the most
excellent and chief persons in the said battle." The Relique of St.
Cuthbert afterwards became of great importance in military events. For
soon after this battle, says the same author, "The prior caused a goodly
and sumptuous banner to be made, (which is then described at great
length,) and in the midst of the same banner-cloth was the said holy
relique and corporax-cloth enclosed, etc. etc., and so sumptuously
finished, and absolutely perfected, this banner was dedicated to holy
St. Cuthbert, of intent and purpose, that for the future it should be
carried to any battle, as occasion should serve; and was never carried
and shewed at any battle but by the especial grace of God Almighty, and
the mediation of holy St. Cuthbert, it brought home victory; which
banner-cloth, after the dissolution of the abbey, fell into the
possession of Dean <span class="smcap">Whittingham</span>, whose wife was called <span class="smcap">Katharine</span>, being a
French woman, (as is most credibly reported by eye-witnesses,) did most
injuriously burn the same in her fire, to the open contempt and disgrace
of all ancient and goodly reliques."&mdash;Extracted from a book entitled,
<i>Durham Cathedral, as it stood before the Dissolution of the Monastery</i>.
It appears, from the old metrical History, that the above-mentioned
banner was carried by the Earl of Surrey to Flodden Field.&mdash;W. W. 1815.</p></div>

Whitaker. "Rylstone Fell yet exhibits a monument of the old warfare
between the Nortons and Cliffords. On a point of very high ground,
commanding an immense prospect, and protected by two deep ravines, are
the remains of a square tower, expressly said by Dodsworth to have been
built by Richard Norton. The walls are of strong grout-work, about four
feet thick. It seems to have been three stories high. Breaches have been
industriously made in all the sides, almost to the ground, to render it
untenable.
</p><p>
"But Norton Tower was probably a sort of pleasure-house in summer, as
there are, adjoining to it, several large mounds, (two of them are
pretty entire,) of which no other account can be given than that they
were butts for large companies of archers.
</p><p>
"The place is savagely wild, and admirably adapted to the uses of a
watch-tower."&mdash;W. W. 1815. (See note VII. <a href="#Page_201">p. 201</a>.)&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>
</p><p>
The remains of Norton Tower are not in the highest point of the Rylstone
Fells, but on one of the western ridges: and there are now only four
bare roofless rectangular walls. It was originally both a watch-tower
and a hunting-tower. Looking towards Malham to the north and north-west,
the view is exactly as described in the poem.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

forfeited to the crown, where they remained till the 2d or 3d of James;
they were then granted to Francis Earl of Cumberland." From an accurate survey
made at that time, several particulars have been extracted by Dr. W. It
appears that the mansion-house was then in decay. "Immediately adjoining
is a close, called the Vivery, so called undoubtedly from the French
Vivier, or modern Latin Viverium; for there are near the house large
remains of a pleasure-ground, such as were introduced in the earlier
part of Elizabeth's time, with topiary works, fish-ponds, an island,
etc. The whole township was ranged by an hundred and thirty red deer,
the property of the Lord, which, together with the wood, had, after the
attainder of Mr. Norton, been committed to Sir Stephen Tempest. The
wood, it seems, had been abandoned to depredations, before which time it
appears that the neighbourhood must have exhibited a forest-like and
sylvan scene. In this survey, among the old tenants, is mentioned one
Richard Kitchen, butler to Mr. Norton, who rose in rebellion with his
master, and was executed at Ripon."&mdash;W. W. 1815.</p></div>

called Rylstone beck, flows westwards into the Aire. Another makes its
way eastwards towards the Wharfe, joins Linton beck, and so enters
Wharfe between Linton Church and Grassington Bridge. It is to the latter
that Wordsworth refers, although the former is now called Rylstone
beck.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

Wharf forks off into two great branches, one of which retains the name
of Wharfdale to the source of the river; the other is usually called
Littondale, but more anciently and properly Amerdale. Dern-brook, which
runs along an obscure valley from the N. W., is derived from a Teutonic
word, signifying concealment."&mdash;Dr. <span class="smcap">Whitaker</span>.&mdash;W. W. 1815.
</p><p>
The valley of Littondale, as is shown in Wordsworth's note, once bore
the name of Amerdale. Though the name is not now given to the beck, it
survives, singularly enough, in one pool in the stream, where it joins
the Wharfe, which is still called "Amerdale Dub."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

a south-westerly direction at Arncliffe, making a "deep fork," and is
called Dernbrook. Dern means seclusion, and two or three miles up this
ghyll is a farm-house bearing the name of Dernbrook House. "The phrase
'By lurking Dernbrook's pathless side' is so appropriate," says the late
incumbent of Arncliffe, the Ven. Archdeacon Boyd, in a letter to the
editor, "that it would almost seem that Wordsworth had been there." Mr.
Boyd adds, "In the illustrated edition of <i>The White Doe</i>, published by
Longmans a few years ago, there is an illustration by Birket Foster of
the Dernbrook House, the original of which I had the honour to supply.

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_UU_444" id="Footnote_UU_444"></a><a href="#FNanchor_UU_444"><span class="label">[UU]</span></a> Which is thus described by Dr. Whitaker:&mdash;"On the plain
summit of the hill are the foundations of a strong wall, stretching from
the S. W. to the N. E. corner of the tower, and to the edge of a very
deep glen. From this glen, a ditch, several hundred yards long, runs
south to another deep and rugged ravine. On the N. and W. where the
banks are very steep, no wall or mound is discoverable, paling being the
only fence that would stand on such ground.
</p><p>
"From the Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border, it appears that such pounds
for deer, sheep, etc., were far from being uncommon in the south of
Scotland. The principle of them was something like that of a wire
mouse-trap. On the declivity of a steep hill, the bottom and sides of
which were fenced so as to be impassable, a wall was constructed nearly
level with the surface on the outside, yet so high within that without
wings it was impossible to escape in the opposite direction. Care was
probably taken that these enclosures should contain better feed than the
neighbouring parks or forests; and whoever is acquainted with the habits
of these sequacious animals, will easily conceive, that if the leader
was once tempted to descend into the snare, an herd would follow."
</p><p>
I cannot conclude without recommending to the notice of all lovers of
beautiful scenery&mdash;Bolton Abbey and its neighbourhood. This enchanting
spot belongs to the Duke of Devonshire; and the superintendance of it
has for some years been entrusted to the Rev. William Carr, who has most
skilfully opened out its features; and in whatever he has added, has
done justice to the place by working with an invisible hand of art in
the very spirit of nature.&mdash;W. W. 1815.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_VV_445" id="Footnote_VV_445"></a><a href="#FNanchor_VV_445"><span class="label">[VV]</span></a> The late Archdeacon of Craven wrote to me of this, "There
never can have been a Lady Chapel in the usual place at Bolton, for the
altar was close to the east window. I never heard of a Saint Mary's
<i>shrine</i>; but, most probably, the church was dedicated to St. Mary, in
which case she" (the Lady Emily) "would be speaking of the building. In
proof of this, the Priory of Embsay was dedicated to St. Mary; and
naturally the dedication, on the removal from Embsay to Bolton, would be
renewed. See Whitaker, p. 369, in extracting from the compotus, 'Comp.
Monasterii be' Mar' de Boulton in Craven.'" It may be added that the
whole church being dedicated to St. Mary&mdash;as in the case of the
Cistercian buildings&mdash;there would be no Lady Chapel. The mention in
detail of "prostrate altars," "shrines defaced," "fret-work imagery,"
"plates of ornamental brass," and "sculptured Forms of Warriors" in the
closing canto of <i>The White Doe</i> is&mdash;like the "one sequestered hillock
green" where Francis Norton was supposed to "sleep in his last
abode"&mdash;part of the imaginative drapery of the poem.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

writer of first-rate merit in all that concerns the past; but such
was his aversion from the modern spirit, as shown in the spread
of manufactories in those districts of which he treats, that his
readers are left entirely ignorant both of the progress of these
arts and their real bearing upon the comfort, virtues, and
happiness of the inhabitants. While wandering on foot
through the fertile valleys and over the moorlands of the
Apennine that divide Yorkshire from Lancashire, I used to be
delighted with observing the number of substantial cottages that
had sprung up on every side, each having its little plot of fertile
ground won from the surrounding waste. A bright and warm
fire, if needed, was always to be found in these dwellings.
The father was at his loom; the children looked healthy and
happy. Is it not to be feared that the increase of mechanic
power had done away with many of these blessings, and
substituted many ills? Alas! if these evils grow, how are
they to be checked, and where is the remedy to be found?
Political economy will not supply it; that is certain; we must
look to something deeper, purer, and higher.&mdash;I. F.]</p>

<p>In a letter to Wordsworth in 1815, Charles Lamb wrote
thus of <a href="#THE_FORCE_OF_PRAYERA"><i>The Force of Prayer</i></a>, "Young Romilly is divine; the
reasons of his mother's grief being remediless. I never saw
parental love carried up so high, towering above the other loves.
Shakspeare had done something for the filial in Cordelia, and,
by implication, for the fatherly too, in Lear's resentment; he
left it for you to explore the depths of the maternal heart....
When I first opened upon the just mentioned poem, in a careless
tone, I said to Mary, as if putting a riddle, '<i>What is good for a
bootless bene?</i>' To which, with infinite presence of mind (as
the jest-book has it), she answered, 'A shoeless pea.' It was
the first joke she ever made.... I never felt deeply in my
life if that poem did not make me feel, both lately and when I
read it in MS." (<i>The Letters of Charles Lamb</i>, edited by Alfred
Ainger, vol. i. p. 288.)&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p>Wordsworth began to write on the Convention of Cintra in
November 1808, and sent two articles on the subject to the
December (1808) and January (1809) numbers of <i>The Courier</i>.
The subject grew in importance to him as he discussed it: and
he threw his reflections on the subject into the form of a small
treatise, the preface to which was dated 20th May 1809. The
full title of this (so-called) "Tract" is "Concerning the Relations
of Great Britain, Spain, and Portugal to each other, and
to the common Enemy, at this crisis; and specifically as affected
by the Convention of Cintra: the whole brought to the test of
those Principles, by which alone the Independence and Freedom
of Nations can be Preserved or Recovered."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<h2><a name="Year_1809" id="Year_1809"></a>1809</h2>


<p>The poems belonging to the years 1809 and 1810 were
mainly sonnets&mdash;although <i>The Excursion</i> was being added to
at intervals. Of twenty-four which were included by Wordsworth,
in the final arrangement of his poems, among those
"dedicated to National Independence and Liberty," fourteen
belong to the year 1809, and ten to 1810. It is difficult
to ascertain the principle which guided him in determining
the succession of these sonnets. They were not placed in
chronological order; nor is there any historical or topographical
reason for their being arranged as they were. I have therefore
felt at liberty to depart from his order, to the following extent.</p>

<p>The six sonnets referring to the Tyrolese have been brought
together in one group. Those containing allusions to Spain
might have been similarly treated; but the sonnets on Schill,
the King of Sweden, and Napoleon&mdash;as arranged by Wordsworth
himself&mdash;do not break the continuity of the series on
Spain, in the same way that the insertion of those on Palafox and
Zaragoza interferes with the unity of the Tyrolean group; and
the re-arrangement of the latter series enables me more conveniently
to append to it a German translation of the sonnets,
and a paper upon them, by Alois Brandl.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p>The expectation that the Germans would rise against the
French in 1807 was realised only in the Tyrol. Andreas Hofer,
an innkeeper in the Passeierthal, was the chief of the Tyrolese
leaders. More than once he called his countrymen to arms,
and was successful for a time. The Bavarians, however,
defeated him, in October 1809. He was tried by court-martial,
and shot in 1810.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<p>I append to this series of sonnets on the Tyrol and the
Tyrolese the translation of a paper contributed by Alois Brandl,
a Tyrolean, to the <i>Neue Freie Presse</i> of October 22, 1880.
Herr Brandl was for some time in England investigating the
traces of a German literary influence on Coleridge, Wordsworth,
and their contemporaries.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"It was in the year 1809; Napoleon was at the height of
his career of victory; and England alone of all his opponents
held the supremacy at sea. For years the English were the
only representatives of freedom in Europe. At last it seemed
that two fortunate allies arose to join their cause&mdash;the insurgents
in Spain and in the little land of Tyrol. No wonder then that
now British poets sympathised with the victors at the hill of
Isel, and praised their courage and their leaders, and at last,
when they were overcome by superior forces, laid the laurel
wreath of tragic heroism on their graves.</p>

<p>"Thirty or forty years before, English poets would scarcely
have shown such a lively interest in a war of independence in a
foreign country. They stood under the curse of narrow-mindedness
and one-sidedness both in politics and in art, so that their
smooth-running verses neither sought nor found a response even
in the hearts of their own fellow-countrymen. The poets who
appeared before the public in the year 1798 with the famous
'Lyrical Ballads' were the first to strike out a new path.
Although differing considerably from one another in other
respects, they agreed in their opposition to the conventionality
of the old school."</p>

<p class="center" style="letter-spacing: 3em;">&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>"Wordsworth lived in a simple little house on the romantic
lake of Grasmere, in the heart of the mountains of Westmoreland.
He studied more in his walks over heath and field than
in books, and entered with interest into the questions affecting
the good of the country people around him. All this of
necessity impelled him to take a warm interest in the herdsmen
of the Alps.</p>

<p>"But the Tyrolese inspired him with still greater interest on
political grounds. Like all the lake poets, he was an enthusiastic
admirer, not of the French revolution, but of the republic
as long as it seemed to desire the realization of the ideas of
Liberty, Fraternity, Equality, and the rest of Rousseau's Arcadian
notions; and it was a bitter disillusion for him, as well as for
Klopstock, when this much-praised home of the free rights of
man resolved itself into the empire of Napoleon. From this
moment he took his place on the side of the enemies of France,
and particularly on the side of the Tyrolese, since they had never
lost the natural simplicity of their habits, and had regained the
hereditary freedom, of which they had been deprived, with the
sword. Thus arose the curious paradox, that a republican poet
glorified spontaneously the cause of an exceedingly monarchical
and conservative country.</p>

<p>"Wordsworth gave vent to his enthusiasm in six sonnets,
which, as far as power of language and vigour of thought are
concerned, form interesting companion-pieces to the poems of
the contemporary Tyrolese poet Alois Weissenbach. In the
first three sonnets the splendour of the Alpine world, which he
knew from his journeys in Switzerland, forms the background
of the picture. In the foreground he sees a band of brave and
daring men, in whose hearts he thought he could find all his
own moral pathos. Many of the features which he has introduced
certainly show more ideal fancy than knowledge of detail;
but it was not his purpose to compose a correct report of the
war, but to give an exciting description of the heroes of this
struggle for independence, in order that, even though they
themselves should be overpowered, their spirit might arise again
among his own fellow-countrymen. In the fourth sonnet, in
his enthusiasm for the Tyrolese, he has treated the German
universities with unnecessary severity; but this does not prove
any intentional want of fairness on his part, for at that time our
universities stood under general discredit in England as the hotbeds
of the wildest metaphysics and political dreams. The events
of the year 1813 would probably induce Wordsworth to view them
in a more favourable light. Similarly the sixth sonnet is not quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
just to Austria; in particular Wordsworth has made decidedly
too little allowance for the fact that the Emperor Franz I. ceded
the Tyrol quite against his own will under the pressure of
circumstances. But in this case we must not simply impute all
the blame to the poet; for as we see from the diary of his friend
Southey, his information as to the doings of Austria was of a
most vague and unfavourable character. We, however, cannot
have any wish to impute to Austria the sins of ill-advised
diplomacy."</p>

<p>Palafox-y-Melzi, Don Joseph (1780-1847), immortalized by
his heroic defence of Saragossa in 1808-9. He was of an old
Aragon family, and entered the Spanish army at an early age.
In 1808, when twenty-nine years of age, he was appointed
governor of Saragossa, by the people of the town, who were
menaced by the French armies. He defended it with a few
men, against immense odds, and compelled the French to
abandon the siege, after sixty-one days' attack, and the loss of
thousands. Saragossa, however, was too important to lose, and
Marshals Mortier and Moncy renewed the siege with a large
army. Palafox (twice defeated outside) retired to the fortress
as before, where the men, women, and children fought in
defence, till the city was almost a heap of ruins. Typhus
attacked the garrison within, while the French army assailed it
from without. Palafox, smitten by the fever, had to give up
the command to another, who signed a capitulation next day.
He was sent a prisoner to Vincennes, and kept there for nearly
five years, till the restoration of Ferdinand VII., when he was
sent back on a secret mission to Madrid. In 1814 he was
appointed Captain-General of Aragon; but for about thirty
years&mdash;till his death in 1847&mdash;he took no part in public affairs.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

1809, after a heroic defence, which may recall the sieges of
Numantiaor Saguntum. Every street, almost every house, had
been hotly contested; the monks, and even the women, had
taken a conspicuous share in the defence; more than 40,000
bodies of both sexes and every age testified to the obstinate
courage of the besieged." (See Dyer's <i>History of Modern Europe</i>,

<p>Ferdinand von Schill, a distinguished Prussian officer, born
1773, entered the army 1789, was seriously wounded in the
battle of Jena, but took the field again at the head of a free
corps. Indignant at the subjection of his country to Buonaparte,
he resolved to make a great effort for the liberation of Germany,
collected a small body of troops, and commenced operations on
the Elbe; but after a few successes was overpowered and slain
at Stralsund, May 31, 1809. On June 4, 1809, Wordsworth
writing to Daniel Stewart, editor of <i>The Courier</i> newspaper,
says, "Many thanks for the newspaper. Schill is a fine fellow."
The sonnet was doubtless inspired by what he thus heard of
Schill.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p>The royal Swede, "who never did to Fortune bend the knee,"
was Gustavus IV. He abdicated in 1809, and came to London
at the close of the year 1810. Compare the earlier sonnet on
the same King of Sweden (vol. ii. p. 338), beginning&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">The Voice of song from distant lands shall call.</span>
</div></div>

<p>In the edition of 1827, Wordsworth added the following
note:&mdash;"In this and a former Sonnet, in honour of the same
Sovereign, let me be understood as a Poet availing himself of
the situation which the King of Sweden occupied, and of
the principles avowed in his manifestos; as laying hold of
these advantages for the purpose of embodying moral truths.
This remark might, perhaps, as well have been suppressed;
for to those who may be in sympathy with the course of these
Poems, it will be superfluous; and will, I fear, be thrown away
upon that other class, whose besotted admiration of the intoxicated
despot here placed in contrast with him, is the most
melancholy evidence of degradation in British feeling and
intellect which the times have furnished."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p>This may refer to Palafox, alluded to in the sonnet (<a href="#Page_222">p. 222</a>)
beginning, "And is it among rude untutored Dales," and in
the one next in order in the series (<a href="#Page_223">p. 223</a>); although, from the
latter sonnet, it would seem that Wordsworth did not know
that Palafox was, in 1809, a prisoner at Vincennes.</p>

<p>In his edition of the poems published in 1837, Professor
Henry Reed of Philadelphia said, "He must be dull of heart
who, in perusing this series of Poems 'dedicated to Liberty,'
does not feel his affection for his own country&mdash;wherever it
may be&mdash;and his love of freedom, under whatever form of
government his lot may have been cast&mdash;at once invigorated and
chastened into a purer and more thoughtful emotion."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<h2>EPITAPHS TRANSLATED FROM CHIABRERA</h2>


<p>[Those from Chiabrera were chiefly translated when Mr.
Coleridge was writing his <i>Friend</i>, in which periodical my
"Essay on Epitaphs," written about that time, was first
published. For further notice of Chiabrera, in connection with
his Epitaphs, see <i>Musings near Aquapendente</i>.&mdash;I. F.]</p>

<p>It is better to print all the Epitaphs from Chiabrera together,
than to spread them out over the years when they were written
or published. Some of them were certainly written in 1809, or
at least before 1810; others at a later date. But it is impossible
to say in what year those published after 1810 were composed.
They are all to be found in the class of "Epitaphs and Elegiac
Pieces."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p>I have been unable to obtain any definite information in
reference to the persons commemorated in these epitaphs by
Chiabrera: Francesco Ceni, Titus, Ambrosio Salinero, Roberto
Dati, Lelius, Francesco Pozzobonnelli, and Balbi. Mr. W.
M. Rossetti writes to me that he "supposes all the men named
by Chiabrera to be such as enjoyed a certain local and temporary
reputation, which has hardly passed down to any sort of posterity,
and certainly not to the ordinary English reader."</p>

<p>Chiabrera was born at Savona on the 8th of June 1552, and
educated at Rome. He entered the service of Cardinal Cornaro,
married in his 50th year, lived to the age of 85, and died
October 14, 1637. His poetical faculty showed itself late.
"Having commenced to read the Greek writers at home, he
conceived a great admiration for Pindar, and strove successfully
to imitate him. He was not less happy in catching the naïve
and pleasant spirit of Anacreon; his canzonetti being distinguished
for their ease and elegance, while his <i>Lettere Famigliari</i>
was the first attempt to introduce the poetical epistle into
Italian Literature. He wrote also several epics, bucolics, and
dramatic poems. His <i>Opere</i> appeared at Venice, in 6 vols., in
1768."</p>

<p>Wordsworth says of him, in his <i>Essay on Epitaphs</i>, where
translations of two of those Epitaphs of Chiabrera first appeared
(see <i>The Friend</i>, February 22, 1810, and notes to <i>The Excursion</i>)&mdash;"His
life was long, and every part of it bore appropriate
fruits. Urbino, his birth-place, might be proud of him, and
the passenger who was entreated to pray for his soul has a wish
breathed for his welfare.... The Epitaphs of Chiabrera are
twenty-nine in number, and all of them, save two, upon men
probably little known at this day in their own country, and
scarcely at all beyond the limits of it; and the reader is
generally made acquainted with the moral and intellectual
excellence which distinguished them by a brief history of the
course of their lives, or a selection of events and circumstances,
and thus they are individualized; but in the two other instances,
namely, in those of Tasso and Raphael, he enters into no
particulars, but contents himself with four lines expressing one
sentiment, upon the principle laid down in the former part of
this discourse, when the subject of the epitaph is a man of
prime note...."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>Compare the poem <i>Musings near Aquapendente</i>. In reference
to the places referred to in these Epitaphs of Chiabrera, it
may be mentioned that Savona (Epitaphs <a href="#III"><span class="allcapsc">III.</span></a>, <a href="#IV"><span class="allcapsc">IV.</span></a>, <a href="#V"><span class="allcapsc">V.</span></a>, <a href="#VII"><span class="allcapsc">VII.</span></a>, <a href="#VIII"><span class="allcapsc">VIII.</span></a>)
is a town in the Genovese territory; Permessus (Epitaphs <a href="#V"><span class="allcapsc">V.</span></a>
and <a href="#IX"><span class="allcapsc">IX.</span></a>) a river of B&oelig;otia, rising in Mount Helicon and flowing
round it, hence sacred to the Muses; and that the fountain
of Hippocrene&mdash;also referred to in Epitaph <a href="#V"><span class="allcapsc">V.</span></a>&mdash;was not far
distant. Sebeto (Epitaph <a href="#VII"><span class="allcapsc">VII.</span></a>), now cape Faro, is a Sicilian

<h2><a name="Year_1810" id="Year_1810"></a>1810</h2>


<p>As indicated in the editorial note to the poems belonging to
the year 1809, those of 1810 were mainly sonnets, suggested
by the events occurring on the Continent of Europe, and the
patriotic efforts of the Spaniards to resist Napoleon. I have
assigned the two referring to Flamininus, entitled <a href="#ON_A_CELEBRATED_EVENT_IN_ANCIENT"><i>On a
Celebrated Event in Ancient History</i></a>, to the same year. They
were first published in 1815, and seem to have been due to
the same impulse which led Wordsworth to write the "Sonnets
dedicated to Liberty."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p>This "Roman Master" "on Grecian ground" was T.
Quintius Flamininus, one of the ablest and noblest of the
Roman generals (230-174 <span class="allcapsc">B.C.</span>). He was successful against
Philip of Macedon, overran Thessaly in 198, and conquered the
Macedonian army in 197, defeating Philip at Cynoscephalæ.
He concluded a peace with the vanquished. "In the spring of
196, the Roman commission arrived in Greece to arrange,
conjointly with Flamininus, the affairs of the country: they also
brought with them the terms on which a definite peace was to
be concluded with Philip.... The Ætolians exerted themselves
to excite suspicions among the Greeks as to the sincerity of the
Romans in their dealings with them. Flamininus, however,
insisted upon immediate compliance with the terms of the
peace.... In this summer, the Isthmian games were celebrated
at Corinth, and thousands from all parts of Greece flocked
thither. Flamininus, accompanied by the ten commissioners,
entered the assembly, and, at his command, a herald, in name
of the Roman Senate, proclaimed the freedom and independence
of Greece. The joy and enthusiasm at this unexpected declaration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
was beyond all description: the throngs of people that
crowded around Flamininus to catch a sight of their liberator or
touch his garment were so enormous, that even his life was
endangered." (Smith's <i>Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography</i>:
Art. Flamininus, No. 4.)&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

</div></div>

<p>The Ætolians were the only Greeks that entertained suspicion
of the Roman designs from the first. When Flamininus was
wintering in Phocis in 196, and an insurrection broke out at
Opus, some of the citizens had called in the aid of the Ætolians
against the Macedonian garrison; but the gates of the city were
not opened to admit the Ætolian volunteers till Flamininus
arrived. Then in the battle at the heights of Cynoscephalæ,
where the Macedonian army was routed, the Ætolian contingent,
which had helped Flamininus, claimed the sole credit of the
victory; and wished no truce made with Philip, as they were
bent on the destruction of the Macedonian power. The Ætolians
aimed subsequently at exciting suspicion against the sincerity of
Flamininus. In the second sonnet, Wordsworth's sympathy
seems to have been with the Ætolians, as much as it was with
the Swiss and the Tyrolese in their attitude to Buonaparte. But
Flamininus was not a Napoleon.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p class="hang">The ancient oak of Guernica, says Laborde in his account of

under which they swore to the Biscayans to maintain their

<h3>TO SIR GEORGE HOWLAND BEAUMONT, BART.</h3>

<h4>FROM THE SOUTH-WEST COAST OF CUMBERLAND.&mdash;1811</h4>

<p class="center">Composed 1811.&mdash;Published 1842</p>


<p>[This poem opened, when first written, with a paragraph
that has been transferred as an introduction to the first series of
my Scotch Memorials. The journey, of which the first part is
here described, was from Grasmere to Bootle on the south-west
coast of Cumberland, the whole among mountain roads through
a beautiful country; and we had fine weather. The verses end
with our breakfast at the head of Yewdale in a yeoman's house,
which, like all the other property in that sequestered vale, has
passed or is passing into the hands of Mr. James Marshall of
Monk Coniston&mdash;in Mr. Knott's, the late owner's, time called
Waterhead. Our hostess married a Mr. Oldfield, a lieutenant
in the Navy. They lived together for some time at Hacket,
where she still resides as his widow. It was in front of that
house, on the mountain side, near which stood the peasant who,
while we were passing at a distance, saluted us, waving a
kerchief in her hand as described in the poem.<a name="FNanchor_A_532" id="FNanchor_A_532"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_532" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> (This matron
and her husband were then residing at the Hacket. The house
and its inmates are referred to in the fifth book of <i>The Excursion</i>,

</div></div>

<p>The dog which we met with soon after our starting belonged to
Mr. Rowlandson, who for forty years was curate of Grasmere
in place of the rector who lived to extreme old age in a state of
insanity. Of this Mr. R. much might be said, both with
reference to his character, and the way in which he was
regarded by his parishioners. He was a man of a robust frame,
had a firm voice and authoritative manner, of strong natural
talents, of which he was himself conscious, for he has been
heard to say (it grieves me to add) with an oath&mdash;"If I had
been brought up at college I should have been a bishop."
Two vices used to struggle in him for mastery, avarice and the
love of strong drink; but avarice, as is common in like cases,
always got the better of its opponent; for, though he was often
intoxicated, it was never I believe at his own expense. As has
been said of one in a more exalted station, he would take any
<i>given</i> quantity. I have heard a story of him which is worth
the telling. One summer's morning, our Grasmere curate,
after a night's carouse in the vale of Langdale, on his return
home, having reached a point near which the whole of the vale
of Grasmere might be seen with the lake immediately below
him, stepped aside and sat down on the turf. After looking
for some time at the landscape, then in the perfection of its
morning beauty, he exclaimed&mdash;"Good God, that I should
have led so long such a life in such a place!" This no doubt
was deeply felt by him at the time, but I am not authorised to
say that any noticeable amendment followed. Penuriousness
strengthened upon him as his body grew feebler with age. He
had purchased property and kept some land in his own hands,
but he could not find in his heart to lay out the necessary hire
for labourers at the proper season, and consequently he has
often been seen in half-dotage working his hay in the month of
November by moonlight, a melancholy sight which I myself
have witnessed. Notwithstanding all that has been said, this
man, on account of his talents and superior education, was
looked up to by his parishioners, who without a single exception
lived at that time (and most of them upon their own small
inheritances) in a state of republican equality, a condition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
favourable to the growth of kindly feelings among them, and in
a striking degree exclusive to temptations to gross vice and
scandalous behaviour. As a pastor their curate did little or
nothing for them; but what could more strikingly set forth the
efficacy of the Church of England through its Ordinances and
Liturgy than that, in spite of the unworthiness of the minister,
his church was regularly attended; and, though there was not
much appearance in the flock of what might be called animated
piety, intoxication was rare, and dissolute morals unknown.
With the Bible they were for the most part well acquainted;
and, as was strikingly shown when they were under affliction,
must have been supported and comforted by habitual belief in
those truths which it is the aim of the Church to inculcate.
<i>Loughrigg Tarn.</i>&mdash;This beautiful pool and the surrounding
scene are minutely described in my little Book upon the Lakes.
Sir G. H. Beaumont, in the earlier part of his life, was induced,
by his love of nature and the art of painting, to take up his
abode at Old Brathay, about three miles from this spot, so that
he must have seen it under many aspects; and he was so much
pleased with it that he purchased the Tarn with a view to build,
near it, such a residence as is alluded to in this Epistle.
Baronets and knights were not so common in that day as now,
and Sir Michael le Fleming, not liking to have a rival in that
kind of distinction so near him, claimed a sort of Lordship over
the territory, and showed dispositions little in unison with those
of Sir G. Beaumont, who was eminently a lover of peace. The
project of building was in consequence given up, Sir George
retaining possession of the Tarn. Many years afterwards a
Kendal tradesman born upon its banks applied to me for the
purchase of it, and accordingly it was sold for the sum that had
been given for it, and the money was laid out under my direction
upon a substantial oak fence for a certain number of yew trees
to be planted in Grasmere church-yard; two were planted in
each enclosure, with a view to remove, after a certain time, the
one which throve least. After several years, the stouter plant
being left, the others were taken up and placed in other parts
of the same church-yard, and were adequately fenced at the
expense and under the care of the late Mr. Barber, Mr. Greenwood,
and myself: the whole eight are now thriving, and are
already an ornament to a place which, during late years, has
lost much of its rustic simplicity by the introduction of iron
palisades to fence off family burying-grounds, and by numerous
monuments, some of them in very bad taste; from which this
place of burial was in my memory quite free. See the lines in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
the sixth book of <i>The Excursion</i> beginning&mdash;"Green is the
church-yard, beautiful and green." The <a href="#EPISTLE"><i>Epistle</i></a> to which these
notes refer, though written so far back as 1804,<a name="FNanchor_C_534" id="FNanchor_C_534"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_534" class="fnanchor">[C]</a> was carefully
revised so late as 1842, previous to its publication. I am loth
to add, that it was never seen by the person to whom it is
addressed. So sensible am I of the deficiencies in all that I
write, and so far does everything I attempt fall short of what I
wish it to be, that even private publication, if such a term may
be allowed, requires more resolution than I can command. I
have written to give vent to my own mind, and not without
hope that, some time or other, kindred minds might benefit by
my labours: but I am inclined to believe I should never have
ventured to send forth any verses of mine to the world if it had
not been done on the pressure of personal occasions. Had I

The mighty tumults of the <span class="smcap">House of Keys</span>;
</p>

<p>The Isle of Man has a constitution of its own, independent
of the Imperial Parliament. The House of twenty-four Keys
is the popular assembly, corresponding to the British House of
Commons; the Lieutenant-Governor and Council constitute the
Upper House. All legislative measures must be first considered
and passed by both branches, and afterwards transmitted to the
English Sovereign for the Royal Assent before becoming law.</p>

<p>In a letter written from Bootle to Sir George Beaumont on
the 28th August 1811, Wordsworth says:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot">"This is like most others, a bleak and treeless coast, but
abounding in corn fields, and with a noble beach, which is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
delightful either for walking or riding. The Isle of Man is
right opposite our window; and though in this unsettled
weather often invisible, its appearance has afforded us great
amusement. One afternoon above the whole length of it was
stretched a body of clouds, shaped and coloured like a magnificent
grove in winter, when whitened with snow and illuminated,
by the morning sun, which, having melted the snow
in part, has intermingled black masses among the brightness.
The whole sky was scattered over with fleecy dark clouds, such
as any sunshiny day produces, and which were changing their
shapes and positions every moment. But this line of clouds
was immovably attached to the island, and manifestly took their
shape from the influence of its mountains. There appeared to
be just span enough of sky to allow the hand to slide between
the top of Snâfell, the highest peak in the island, and the base
of this glorious forest, in which little change was noticeable for
more than the space of half an hour."</p>

<p>In the Fenwick note, Wordsworth tells us that this <a href="#EPISTLE"><i>Epistle</i></a>
was written in 1804; and by referring to the note prefixed to
the first poem in the "Memorials of a Tour in Scotland," 1803,
(see vol. ii. p. 377), it will be seen that the lines entitled
<i>Departure from the Vale of Grasmere, August, 1803</i>, beginning&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">The gentlest Shade that walked Elysian plains,</span>
</div></div>

<p>were "not actually written for the occasion, but transplanted
from my <a href="#EPISTLE"><i>Epistle to Sir George Beaumont</i></a>."</p>

<p>It does not follow from this, however, that the lines belong
to the year 1803 or 1804; because they were not published
along with the earlier "Memorials" of the Scotch Tour, but
appeared for the first time in the edition of 1827. It is certain
that Wordsworth travelled down with his household from the
Grasmere Parsonage to Bootle in August 1811&mdash;mainly to get
some sea-air for his invalid children&mdash;and that he lived there for
some time during the autumn of that year. He <i>may</i> have also
gone down to the south-west coast of Cumberland in 1804, and
then written a part of the poem; but we have no direct
evidence of this; and I rather think that the mention of the
year 1804 to Miss Fenwick is just another instance in which
Wordsworth's memory failed him while dictating these memoranda.
If the poem was not written at different times, but was
composed as a whole in 1811, we may partly account for the
date he gave to Miss Fenwick, when we remember that in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
year 1827 he transferred a part of it (viz. the introduction) to
these "Memorials" of the Scotch Tour of 1803.</p>

It is to be regretted, upon public grounds, that Sir George Beaumont
did not carry into effect his intention of constructing here a Summer
Retreat in the style I have described; as his Taste would have set an example
how buildings, with all the accommodations modern society requires,
might be introduced even into the most secluded parts of this country
without injuring their native character. The design was not abandoned
from failure of inclination on his part, but in consequence of local untowardnesses
which need not be particularised.&mdash;W. W. 1842.</p></div>

<p>John Dyer, author of <i>Grongar Hill</i> (1726), and <i>The Fleece</i>
(1757), was born at Aberglasney, in Caermarthenshire, in
1698, and died in 1758. Both Akenside and Gray, before
Wordsworth's time, had signalised his merit, in opposition to
the dicta of Johnson and Horace Walpole. The passage which
Wordsworth quotes is from <i>The Fleece</i>, in which Dyer is referring
to his own ancestors, who were weavers, and "fugitives
from superstition's rage," and who brought the art of weaving
"from Devon" to</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>It will be observed that Wordsworth quotes this last line of
Dyer accurately in the edition of 1815, but changed it in 1827.</p>

<p>This sonnet was possibly written before 1811, as in a letter
to Lady Beaumont, dated November 20, 1811, he speaks of it
as written "some time ago." In that letter Wordsworth writes
thus of Dyer:&mdash;"His poem is in several places dry and heavy,
but its beauties are innumerable, and of a high order. In
point of <i>imagination</i> and purity of style, I am not sure that he
is not superior to any writer of verse since the time of Milton."
He then transcribes his sonnet, and adds&mdash;"In the above is
one whole line from <i>The Fleece</i>, and also other expressions.
When you read <i>The Fleece</i>, you will recognise them."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p>It was for Sarah Hutchinson that this <i>Song</i> was written. She
lived, for the most part, either at Brinsop Court Herefordshire,
or at Rydal Mount Westmoreland, or at Greta Hall Keswick.
When living at Greta Hall, she acted as Southey's amanuensis.
She also frequently transcribed poems for Wordsworth, at
Grasmere, Coleorton, and Rydal Mount.</p>

<p>This refers to the marriage of Thomas Hutchinson (Mrs.
Wordsworth's brother) to Mary Monkhouse, sister of the Mr.
Monkhouse with whom Wordsworth afterwards travelled on the
Continent. The marriage took place on November 1, 1812.
They lived at Nadnorth for eighteen years, and afterwards at
Brinsop Court, Herefordshire, for twenty-one years. To their
son&mdash;the Rev. Thomas Hutchinson of Kimbolton, Leominster,
Herefordshire&mdash;and to their daughter&mdash;Miss Elizabeth
Hutchinson of Rock Villa, West Malvern&mdash;I am indebted for
much information in reference to their uncle and aunts. The
portrait of Wordsworth in his forty-seventh year, by Richard
Carruthers, is in Mr. Hutchinson's possession at the Rectory,
Kimbolton.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p>The reference is to the rejoicings on the Leipzig victory of
the Allied Forces, October 16 to 19, 1813. Napoleon crossed
the Rhine on the 2nd November, and returned to Paris with
the wreck of his army. George III. was English Sovereign;
but, owing to his illness, the Prince of Wales had been appointed
Regent, and assumed executive power in January 1811. The
King died at Windsor in 1820, being eighty-two years of age.
He had been entirely blind for some years before his death.
The "twofold night" referred to in the sonnet is sufficiently
obvious.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

to p. 79 "l. 13." While the note correctly identifies the 7th line of the text of the
poem printed on p. 79, it is actually l. 13. of the poem.</p>

Pg. 204 and the reference has been corrected.</p>
